LAUCK National Guardsmen help Henrietta Glover, 61, and her grandchild Darrienna Cryer, 1, into the shade across the street from the Ernest N. Morial Convention Center in New Orleans. NEW ORLEANS -- Clarence Horton couldn't stop the tears. Five days after Hurricane Katrina devastated this city, help was finally making its way Friday to Convention Center Boulevard. But these weren't tears of gratitude. These were tears of dread. Horton was afraid the sudden heightened military presence in a throng of desperate refugees stranded for days at the Ernest N. Morial Convention Center without any relief might bring violence -- and death. Advertisements "The first blood or the first bullet, it's over. We're going to have a massacre," the 72-year-old retired Greyhound bus driver said. "Please don't let these people get killed." As it turned out, there was nothing to fear. The National Guard arrived at the center en masse shortly after noon Friday. Two helicopters glided back and forth across a sunny New Orleans sky, assessing the scene below. Minutes later came a convoy of troops, followed by another convoy of tractor-trailers bearing ready-to-eat meals of salsa chicken and bottled water. Although much-need relief arrived, it still was unclear when the evacuees might be moved from the Convention Center. Hundreds of school buses throughout Louisiana made the pilgrimage to New Orleans and were waiting on the interstate Friday to pick up remaining refugees at the Superdome and possibly those at the Convention Center. Throughout the city, authorities battled continued looting and at least two fires: one an empty apartment building on South Peters Street, the other in an industrial district in the Bywater neighborhood. But here, the crowd of an estimated 10,000 spent the night and much of the day clearing a path for rescuers: picking up broken glass, human waste and other debris with shovels, straw brooms, bleach and bare hands, and bagging it. Advocate staff photo by ARTHUR D. LAUCK Refugees get one bottle of water and one MRE at the feeding station Friday at the Ernest N. Morial Convention Center in New Orleans. And they cheered the passing parade of Louisiana and Arkansas National Guard troops and law enforcement with applause, whistles and shouts of "Thank you, Jesus!" and "Yes! Yes! Thank God we're saved!" New Orleans Police Superintendent Eddie Compass hopped aboard a Rapides Parish Sheriff's Office truck and, looking shaken by what he saw, pressed a bullhorn to his lips. "We've got food and water and medical attention on the way. I'm going to get y'all out of here," he promised. "We got 30,000 people out of the Superdome, and we can get you out, too. I wouldn't lie to you." By 3 p.m., the crowd -- some of them living in tents fashioned from Mulate's red-checkered tablecloths -- formed single-file lines in the River Center parking lot, next to the Convention Center. For the first time in days, a hush fell over them as National Guard soldiers handed each a ration of food and water. Though desperate to get out, many of these now homeless and unemployed people already are dreaming of their return to New Orleans. As they waited, Sharele Youngblood and her 15-year-old son Jeffrey McKnight were among those who piled food wrappers, empty water bottles and cans into plastic bags. The 36-year-old parent liaison for the Orleans Parish School Board started picking up trash Thursday night -- and did it all over again Friday morning. "We want the buses to get through without any trouble," Youngblood said. "And we don't want to leave our city messy like this because this is still out city and someday, we'll be coming back home." Wearing a trademark red hat, Margaret Avalon sat under the shade of a tree, wondering about the fate of her husband. On Thursday afternoon, he suffered an epileptic seizure while helping distribute food and water dropped by military helicopters. Soldiers pulled him into the chopper. Saying she was certain he is fine, she also was anticipating her return to New Orleans. "The Crescent Lady is not defeated, and she's not dead," Avalon said. "She's just got a very bad war wound. But she'll be back better than ever, I don't know about Mardi Gras 2006, but in 2007, we'll be in our usual spot, yelling at Bacchus." But there are reminders that not everyone will make it. On the grassy median in the middle of Convention Center Boulevard remained the body of the elderly man who died in his lawn chair. Someone laid over him a gold comforter, leaving exposed only a dirty sock-covered foot that will never take those final steps to freedom, or the trip home again.

Kathleen Blanco spent the day with President Bush in what she called a productive day. Blanco asked Bush to send home Louisiana National Guard's 256th combat brigade team from Iraq to help with hurricane aftermath. Some soldiers will have no houses or jobs when they return home. "I'm hearing that a lot of those soldiers are extremely upset about what's happening here and are looking forward to working close to home," Blanco said Friday night. "Our people would rather work closer to home." Bush didn't respond to that request. However, faith has been renewed for Louisiana citizens, Blanco said, and New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin has a "renewed sense of hope" after being under a tremendous amount of stress. Project Hope is the new name given to rebuilding southeast Louisiana. Advertisements "It was just a beautiful thing, and I thought about what it symbolized ? the first ray of real hope for the people who have lost so much," Blanco said. "It means the beginning of the end of the nightmare. There are better days to come." A 501C3 non-profit was created today to better coordinate donations. People can send donations to the Louisiana Disaster Recovery Foundation, P.O. Box 94095, Baton Rouge, LA 70804-9095. The donations will go toward refugees' housing, education, healthcare, and jobs. Visit http://www.louisiana.gov for details. Blanco said Bush spent Friday on the ground watching workers work on the levee and the military's response to hurricane aftermath. Blanco asked for at least 40,000 troops throughout Louisiana. More than 2,000 soldiers will arrive by midnight, making the grand total 7,000. "We have to restore order so that we can begin the process of rebuilding," Blanco said. "People have to be able to walk safely. We cannot have people threatening our citizens and making their lives unsafe." Trailers of water, ice, food, or commercial buses, base camps, staging areas, amphibious personnel carriers, airlift, urban search teams, generators, fuel and communication systems were also on Blanco's wish list. The casualties are still unknown, but the governor expects thousands. The Superdome is practically empty, but the New Orleans Convention Center is still largely occupied. Citizens there will be evacuated Saturday morning. Sen. David Vitter called FEMA's response to the hurricane aftermath an "abject failure." He said he was frustrated that FEMA didn't have a more reasonable plan to something "utterly predictable." He suggested putting Lt. Gen. Russell Honore, a Louisiana native, in charge. Vitter and Sen. Mary Landrieu also spent the day with Bush and Blanco flying over neighborhoods, cities and parishes affected by Katrina. Landrieu asked Bush to appoint a cabinet-level person to immediately coordinate money to rebuild New Orleans and surrounding parishes. She said FEMA's focus hasn't worked this week, but that Bush could make bold decisions to make things happen. "America should never allow this to happen again," Landrieu said. "Forgive us if you think we've made mistakes," she said, adding that lack of investment, communication, organization and the ability to grasp the situation have complicated everything. She said she was confident that after today Bush understood the magnitude of crisis, and that he should make bold decisions. Bush made no promises. "I'm hopeful that today's a turning point," Vitter said. "I learned the last four days not to believe anything until I see it."

A hospital spokesman said at least one baby born since Sunday was named Katrina. Katherine Kiper Bacchus of Kenner expected to have her baby in a New Orleans hospital. Hurricane Katrina sent Bacchus, husband Mark and two small sons on a three-day journey through water and fire to Woman's Hospital in Baton Rouge where Mason Bacchus was born Thursday. Sunday, the Bacchuses started for Memorial Medical Center on Napoleon Avenue by car. They ended up in Baton Rouge after being rescued by a blind man in a canoe, a looter in a boat who happened to be going their way, a Blackhawk helicopter crew and ambulance attendants. Mason Bacchus was among about 100 New Orleans babies admitted or born at Woman's from Sunday to noon Friday. Twenty-nine newborns from University Hospital at the LSU Medical Center in New Orleans arrived at Woman's on Friday morning. Advertisements Another 100 patients -- mostly expectant women and babies from the Baton Rouge area -- were admitted to Woman's this week. Contractions while packing Katherine, on maternity leave from an insurance company, and Mark Bacchus, a telecommunications worker, were deciding where to go as the hurricane turned toward New Orleans. "My contractions started while I was packing," Bacchus said. Bacchus checked with her doctor, Thomas Ryan, who told her Memorial Medical was being evacuated. "Dr. Ryan said meet him at his house on Prytania," Bacchus said. "He was really sweet. No doctor's going to go to that much trouble, but he delivered my three other children." The couple's third son, Marcell, was with his grandmother. The Bacchuses don't know where Marcell is, but they assume he and his grandmother got out of the city with friends. On the way to Prytania Street, the couple decided to swing by Katherine Bacchus' dad's house on South Gayoso near Earhart Boulevard. "The sky looked funny," she said, "but there was no rain." Riding out the storm Bacchus' father was out of town, so she and her husband began getting the house ready for the storm. With nightfall, they decided to bunk down on the second floor of the house. "Then, windows started breaking and the house started shaking," Mark Bacchus said. "We were trying to plug holes and save as much as we could." His wife's contractions got harder. "It's pitch black, and the wind's blowing like heck," Katherine Bacchus said. "My dad's plants are flying by. The hanging plants are blowing straight out." Mark Bacchus tried to keep the front doors closed by pushing a couch against them, but the wind blew the couches away. "We all hugged each other," Bacchus said. "We stayed in the hall until daylight (Monday)." Flood waters rise There was water in the street up to car hubcaps. "We ate and slept until that afternoon," Katherine Bacchus said. "We were happy. We'd gotten through the storm. But the contractions were really hurting." A break in the 17th Street Canal was flooding the city. The Bacchuses watched looters breaking into houses as the water in the street reached car roof level. "I didn't want my wife and kids in that water," Bacchus said. "It smelled of gasoline." The couple watched rats swim by. By Tuesday afternoon, the Bacchuses were desperate. "Then, this guy in a canoe comes out of nowhere," Bacchus said. "He was in his 50s or 60s. He had, what do you call them, cataracts, and he's bumping into trees. The water was chest high on me. I'm 6-2, and he's a foot shorter, but he didn't care. He wanted to help." The man's 7-year-old daughter was in the canoe with sandwiches and soft drinks. Bacchus and the man pulled the canoe for miles to Memorial Medical only to be turned away by police on the hospital's flooding ramp. It took longer to get back to the house as water in the street rose. The water was halfway up the 15-foot steps to Katherine Bacchus' father's house when they got back. The man with the canoe helped them onto the steps and turned to leave. "I saw him walking away," Bacchus said. "I watched him for three blocks. Then, he made a turn, and I couldn't see him." Second rescue One of Katherine Bacchus' cousins waded up holding a talking bird in a cage over his head, a Beagle in an ice chest and a cell phone. "My contractions were getting harder, and the water kept coming up," Bacchus said. "We're calling 911, but we're getting Jefferson Parish 911, and they're relaying. I'm losing the battery in the cell phone." The Bacchuses got out sheets and flashlights to signal helicopters passing overhead to no avail. About 1 a.m. Wednesday, Katherine Bacchus awoke to brightness she thought was a helicopter's searchlight. "I woke my husband. I said, 'It's a helicopter.' I look out the window, and my cousin's house is on fire." A row of three houses were ablaze. "There was a vacant lot next door to us," Katherine Bacchus said. "I'm open, you know, about to have a baby. I wasn't getting in that water. ? There were cats drowning and dogs howling." A man they'd seen looting earlier cruised by in a bay boat powered by batteries hooked to a trolling motor. The looter took the Bacchuses and their children into the boat, along with some other people. "I'm scared for my life," Katherine Bacchus said, "but we have no choice. We're heading for the projects on Earhart, heading for the Superdome." As the looter hooked onto another boat and people in the water tried to climb in, the boat flipped. "I'm holding onto the side, and my feet aren't touching anything," Katherine Bacchus said. When the boat righted, Bacchus was thrown back on board, landing in the bottom of the boat. "She's up in two seconds," her husband laughed. "Bailing with a bucket." Fire in her eyes Bacchus had grabbed his sons, Mark Jr., 4, and Matthew, 2, and was wading toward the Amtrak station. His wife made it onto the railroad tracks but refused to go further. "I could hear people shooting, and there were people dropping bottles from the Claiborne Street Bridge," she said. Bacchus got his wife to her feet, and they walked to the Superdome. Dehydrated and doubled with labor pains, Katherine was offered a ride in an ambulance on the Dome's outside concourse. "This military guy says I can't take my family," she said. "He saw me cut my eyes." The Bacchuses -- all of them -- rode the ambulance onto the floor of the Dome. At 7 p.m. Wednesday, the family was on the heliport next door. A Blackhawk helicopter crewman said the family couldn't fly together. The pilot looked at Katherine, her husband said, and told the crewman, "Get them onboard." The helicopter took the family to the Louis Armstrong International Airport, and an ambulance drove them to Woman's. The family left New Orleans around 10 p.m. Wednesday. Mason was born nine hours later. Mason has stopped breathing twice, his mother said. He was in her arms in her bed shortly before lunch Friday. His brother, Mark, busied himself with the controls that raise and lower their mother's bed. "I can't sleep," Katherine Bacchus said. "I feel like if I go to sleep I'll be back in that water drowning. ? I can only be happy. I'm not worried about the car or the house. I knew we were going to die."

About 32,000 customers of Entergy Corp. in the Baton Rouge area operated without electrical power for the fifth day Friday in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. Virtually all DEMCO customers without power in East Baton Rouge Parish should have been back on by the end of the day, officials said. Bill Benedetto, regional manager for Entergy, said crews hope to have most power to the area restored by Sunday night but emphasized that is a goal, not a certainty. "There are still going to be some small pockets or individual people that won't have it," Benedetto said. "We would hope to have the bulk of it" by Sunday. Entergy has about 145,000 residential and business customers in the Baton Rouge area. About 90,000 customers were without power at the height of the outage on Monday after strong winds from Katrina hit the area. Advertisements Entergy has about 1 million customers in Louisiana. Those without power statewide total 585,247, Benedetto said. About 39,000 Baton Rouge area customers were without power Thursday evening. Work crews on Friday were set to focus on at least 20 areas. The list includes homes near Bluebonnet and Jefferson; Broadmoor; the LSU area; Pollard Estates; north Sherwood Forest; Lobdell; and Ardenwood and Sullivan Road. Some residential customers have complained of outages for several hours and longer after initial electric al power problems were resolved. "Sometimes in restoring power we have to take a circuit out to do some work to get another circuit on," Benedetto said. "Sometime we get it hot (on) and there may be a tree limb on a line that has been weakened and it will take it out again." Robin Keller, public relations manager for DEMCO, said Friday that virtually all of its customers in East Baton Rouge Parish without power should have had it restored by the end of the day. "That being said, there will still be some scattered outages," Keller said. "There could be as many as 100 customers without power, but the primary circuits should be back up by the end of the day (Friday) in East Baton Rouge." The utility serves parts of East Baton Rouge, Ascension, Livingston, East Feliciana, West Feliciana, Tangipahoa and St. Helena parishes. About 75,000 customers were without electrical power at the peak of the problem on Monday, with 21,000 in East Baton Rouge Parish. About 17,000 customers lacked power Friday.

Jones, with her son Alex Jones, left, and daughter Courtney Varise, came from Georgia to search for family from New Orleans. Cynthia Cummings of New Orleans returned Friday to the Baton Rouge River Center -- this time seeking family rather than food and housing. Cummings, who is now staying with cousin Erica Fields of Baton Rouge instead of the shelter, is looking for parents, children, grandchildren and cousins. "A slew of people." The search of a half-inch-thick printed list didn't provide the answers she sought -- a common result for those perusing the list, American Red Cross volunteers conceded. Volunteer Stephanie Welch of Baton Rouge explained that the printed list represents only names from the agency's 18 shelters in East Baton Rouge Parish. "It doesn't help if your family is in the Astrodome." Efforts to help evacuees reunite with each other or contact relatives elsewhere are still in the early stages. Databases and Internet sites are in the works, but information is incomplete and has yet to be centralized, officials said. Advertisements "The first priorities were feeding and securing the people," Dick Burch, a Red Cross volunteer from Joseph, Ore., said. Clerical workers from the Baton Rouge Police Department helped type the lists of evacuee names, and Red Cross volunteers are using public address systems to page evacuees when people come to look for them, Burch said. Means for finding evacuees should become more evolved in the days and weeks ahead, he said. Louisiana State Police are referring inquiries about efforts to locate evacuees to the Red Cross's national headquarters. The disaster relief agency has promoted its toll-free hotline -- 866- GET-INFO, or (866) 438-4636 -- as well as a "Family Links Registry" online at http://www.redcross.org. As of Thursday afternoon, the registry contained more than 1,100 entries -- some for individuals and some for entire families. Most appeared to have been posted by people looking for someone, rather than the evacuees themselves. Other Internet sites like http://www.cnn.com and http://www.nowpublic.com also feature growing lists. Burch said he had heard of private Internet sites put together by individuals. He suggested those with Internet access type the names of missing friends and relatives along with "Hurricane Katrina." Others have tried posting old-fashion fliers. A handwritten message taped to a window at the River Center seeks "Felicio Mercudel 'Tweety.' Please call 225-383-6286." Another, with a photocopied black-and-white photo of an elderly couple, says, "Looking for Harry Farley and Dorris -- Please Call 225-622-1869." Burch said he's heard many stories of families separating as they evacuated. That was the case with Cummings, who waited out the hurricane with relatives at her home, but she fled when the water rose. Her family had gotten word that at least eight relatives were together at the Astrodome in Houston. "Eight is a good start," she said. She couldn't account for at least 20 others from New Orleans and Mandeville. Carmela Burke, a national Red Cross spokeswoman in Washington D.C., encouraged families to work their networks of relatives and friends. That approach is proving effective in the Jewish community, said Rabbi Barry Weinstein of B'nai Israel Synagogue in Baton Rouge. Because there are only two synagogues here, it is relatively simple for people to call and see if their relatives have sought shelter here, he said. A mother from Lafayette, for example, located her daughter by calling his synagogue, Weinstein said. "It's very exciting and a real miracle when families can get reunited," he said.

BELLE CHASSE -- Military authorities plan to put about 45,000 National Guardsmen on the streets from this Naval airbase in the next two days, said Col. Ron Stuckey, who is overseeing the operation. The guardsmen, who mostly are military policemen and rifle infantry, are arriving at the base and preparing for deployment in New Orleans and then in surrounding areas. They come from units in Texas, Arkansas, New Mexico, Alabama, New Jersey, Oklahoma and California. In the past 10 hours, at least 1,000 soldiers were deployed. They plan to send another thousand out tonight. Brig. Gen. Hunt Downer, secretary of the Louisiana Department of Veterans Affairs, said many of the 45,000 soldiers would perform search and rescue, law enforcement, water purification and similar tasks. Advertisements Lt. Col. Ronald Turk of the New Jersey Air National Guard had arrived at the base. He said he had not yet gotten his orders but basically he was prepared to do whatever it is he is told. "A lot of people are hurting here right now and we're ready to help," he said Tech Sgt. George Sikaffy of New Jersey Air National Guard said he has been watching coverage of the hurricane, including the looting. "It's terrible. It's unacceptable," Sikaffy said. He said he has not received orders to shoot to kill, but he'll follow the leadership. Downer was not aware of Gov. Kathleen Blanco's angry statements Thursday night. But he said that guardsmen would use only that force "necessary to repel." National Guard soldiers, as opposed to the regular Army, have full-time jobs and are mobilized only in times of crisis and war. Lt. Col. Pete Schneider of the Louisiana National Guard said 7,000 guardsmen are targeted for law enforcement. "You will see a massive presence of boots on the ground," he said. No active regular military forces will be brought in for this work. Printer Friendly Version Send this story to a friend Advertisements FEATURES

'turns a corner' 09/03/05 La. 'turns a corner' Relief begins to arrive; engineers staunch flooding from lake Advocate staff report NEW ORLEANS -- New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin said Friday he does not think his tirade a day earlier about the lack of a federal response to the Hurricane Katrina disaster "rattled" President Bush, but it did "get the nation's attention." "I think the president is disappointed in the response," Nagin said after meeting with Bush and touring flooded areas of the city. "The president assured me he understood the situation and was fully committed to moving this operation forward," the mayor said. Nagin said he believes his outburst "had some effect" because the president loves frankness. "Yesterday I went off a bit. I feel much better. I think we've gotten everybody's attention. I am cautiously optimistic," he said. Advertisements As far as the evacuation side of the post-Katrina operation is concerned, Nagin said the city should be completely cleared in three to five days. The Louisiana Superdome, which had about 30,000 evacuees, now has about 8,000 to 10,000 and should be evacuee-free by midday today. The Ernest N. Morial Convention Center also has 20,000 to 30,000 evacuees, and there are another 10,000 to 15,000 on the roadways trying to get downtown, he said. Nagin said 1,000 soldiers took control of the convention center Friday and restored "peace" to a chaotic situation. An upbeat Gov. Kathleen Blanco said late Friday that Louisiana "turned a corner today." She gave credit to arriving soldiers, a successful engineering project, and a visit by Bush. Engineers were able to staunch the flow of water from Lake Ponchartrain into the city on Friday. The project's completion, "The first ray of real hope for people who have lost so much," Blanco said. The arrival of troops in the city was a show of force that put "confidence back" into the population, Blanco said. "We have to restore order so that we can begin the process of rebuilding," she said. And Blanco credited Bush's visit Friday with giving her a renewed optimism. "To have the president there was yet another magnificent gesture," Blanco said. "The people here understood that President Bush is deeply committed to Louisiana's citizens." Military authorities plan to put about 45,000 guardsmen on the streets in the next two days, said Col. Ron Stuckey, who is overseeing the operation. Nagin said he also told Bush he is concerned about mosquitoes and disease, and he asked for federal assistance in the form of aerial spraying. "They (mosquitoes) could blow into other states, so we talked about containment," he said. The mayor told reporters Katrina dealt such a knockout punch to the city's tourism industry that the city's coffers will run out of cash in two weeks. The city will need financial help. In other developments Friday: Bush, stung by bipartisan criticism of sluggish federal help, toured the area and acknowledged the failure to stop lawlessness and help desperate people. U.S. Rep. David Vitter, R-La., blasted the federal government's relief efforts as "ineffective." A National Guard convoy carrying relief supplies was met by cheers and catcalls. The Rev. Jesse Jackson called Bush's response "incompetent" and said racism was partly to blame. State and federal officials said they have closed off the entrance of the canal that flooded New Orleans. A charter bus carrying evacuees overturned on Interstate 49 near Opelousas. Bipartisan criticism President Bush admitted during a land and air tour of hard-hit areas of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama that "the (relief) results are not acceptable." Some White House aides and Republicans were glad to hear the president stop defending the administration's response when it was so obvious that conditions were so bad for so many people. "What is not working right, we're going to make it right," Bush said. Congress quickly passed a $10.5 billion aid package Thursday night, and Bush said he would sign it by day's end. Vitter said it will be "a good start." Fellow U.S. Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., called it "comforting." Vitter blasted the federal government's relief efforts as "ineffective" and said people are dying and suffering because of the incompetence. The Federal Emergency Management Agency "has been completely dysfunctional, completely overwhelmed. And I don't understand why," Vitter said. "I think everybody involved has been a day or a half a day late," Vitter said. Bush made a strong commitment to aid survivors, Vitter said. "But in terms of operations of the federal government, it's been a failure." Vitter said disaster officials should plunge ahead, even if they make some mistakes in rescuing survivors and providing aid. He added he is angry that FEMA apparently did not have a plan to address the kind of disaster that occurred though "everything that happened ? has been part of every scenario that we've studied for the last 20 to 30 years." "It seems like there was no coherent plan to deal with this scenario," Vitter said. Also, Republicans joined Democrats in wondering why it was taking so long to relieve the misery. "If we can't respond faster than this to an event we saw coming across the Gulf for days, then why do we think we're prepared to respond to a nuclear or biological attack?" asked former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a Republican. Republican Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts called the government's response "an embarrassment." Rep. Mark Foley, R-Fla., called upon Bush to recall National Guardsmen stationed in Iraq whose homes and families were in the path of Katrina's destruction. First lady Laura Bush, meanwhile, visited Lafayette and said she was pleased by the effort the community was putting into providing shelter at the Cajundome, which now houses more than 6,000 evacuees. Repairing the levee State and federal officials confirmed they have closed off the entrance of the canal that flooded New Orleans. "We have totally isolated the 17th Street Canal from Lake Ponchartrain," said Johnny Bradberry, state Department of Transportation and Development. "This is good news." Boh Brothers was hired to drive pilings across the 17th Street Canal near its mouth with Lake Ponchartrain. That means water from the higher levels of the lake will no longer flow through the canal and into a 500-foot long hole in the floodwall to the below-sea-level neighborhoods of New Orleans. Water from that breach has flooded 80 percent of the city's buildings. Engineers and private contractors are now focusing on fixing the breach, Bradberry said. They are dropping stone and sand into the breach and hope to fix it by Sunday or Monday. "Then we can turn the pumps on," Bradberry said. The water pumps will push the water over the levees, out of the bowl-shaped city, and into the waterways. Brig. Gen. Robert Crear of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said the city would be cleared of water in 36 to 80 days. Images of evacuation Evacuees from the Hyatt hotel were bused to Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport and then flown to Houston, Dallas or San Antonio. School buses, some from the Baton Rouge and Lafayette areas, also were used. The Hyatt and an adjoining conference center were strewn with trash, including plastic water bottles filled with urine. The evacuation images were everywhere: a mother and her little girl crying as they neared a bus bound for Texas; an elderly woman telling an National Guard soldier to "shoot me and put me out of my misery." New Orleans city Councilwoman Jacquelyn Clarkson said troops arrived late Thursday but that, "It's too little, too late." "We didn't get enough help fast enough. This was worse than 9-11. Where's the world?" she said. Clarkson said police were shifting their role to crowd control and looting prevention; while firefighters, State Department of Wildlife and Fisheries personnel, and the Coast Guard were handling rescue missions. "There are still rooftop rescues. We are still getting people out of attics, alive and dead," she said, adding there still are medically needy in hospitals, including Charity Hospital, where they are running out of medication, water and food. A thunderous explosion before daybreak and scattered downtown building fires confirmed the sense that New Orleans was in collapse. The explosion at a warehouse along the Mississippi River about 15 blocks from the French Quarter jostled storm refugees awake and sent a pillar of acrid gray smoke over a city that the mayor has said could be awash with thousands of corpses. Other large fires erupted downtown. In Opelousas, a bus shuttling refugees out of New Orleans crashed, killing one person and injuring more than a dozen, after one of the passengers grew agitated and ended up in a struggle with the driver to get him to stop the bus. Opelousas Police Capt. Mark LeBlanc said that after the tussle, the driver lost control of the bus, sending it across a median strip and overturning on the southbound side of the highway. It wasn't immediately known who died. There were between 45 and 50 passengers on board, 17 of whom were injured, police said. Cheers and catcalls To cries of "Thank you Jesus!" and catcalls of "What took you so long?" a National Guard convoy packed with food, water and medicine rolled through axle-deep floodwaters and descended into a maelstrom of fires and floating corpses. "Lord, I thank you for getting us out of here!" Leschia Radford shrieked amid a throng of storm victims outside the convention center. Some people threw their arms heavenward and others nearly fainted with joy as the trucks and soldiers arrived in the punishing midday heat. But there also were angry and profane jeers from many in the crowd outside the convention center, which a day earlier seemed on the verge of a riot, with desperate people seething over the lack of food or drink. "They should have been here days ago," said Michael Levy, 46, whose words were echoed by those around him yelling, "Hell, yeah!" "We've been sleeping on the ... ground like rats," Levy added. "I say burn this whole ... city down." The soldiers' arrival-in-force came amid angry complaints that the federal government had bungled the relief effort and allowed people to die in the streets for lack of supplies. The guardsmen are mostly military police and infantry. Jackson visits Racism is partly to blame for the deadly aftermath of Katrina, the Rev. Jesse Jackson said, calling Bush's response to the disaster "incompetent." "Today, as the President comes to Louisiana, Alabama and Mississippi for his ceremonial trip to look at the victims of the devastation, he would do well to have a plan more significant than a ceremonial tour," Jackson said. "His whole response is unacceptable." Jackson questioned why Bush has not named black people to top positions in the federal response to the disaster, particularly when the majority of victims remaining stranded in New Orleans are black. U.S. Army Lt. Gen. Russell Honore, a black man, is head of the military task force overseeing all operations in the three states. Jackson was also in Baton Rouge to take part in a local project using a caravan of buses to pick up people stranded in New Orleans. He spoke at a news conference at the state emergency center. The civil rights leader said the flooding that caused thousands to be trapped inside the city was caused by a lack of federal funding for its levee system and hurricane planning. The resulting tragedy, he said, has largely hit New Orleans' black residents, because they were too poor to evacuate before the storm hit. "There's a historical indifference to the pain of poor people and black people" in this country, he said. Jackson also said the news media has "criminalized the people of New Orleans" by focusing on violence in the city. Relief flights land Relief flights donated by airlines began to fly into New Orleans at a rate of about four an hour, beginning midday Friday. Transportation Department spokesman Greg Martin said the planes will be bringing in supplies and leaving with people. Most of the flights will take refugees to Lackland Air Force Base near San Antonio. The Armstrong International airport's building and runway weren't damaged much by the hurricane, but navigational aids such as radar and runway lights weren't working. Advocate staff writers Joe Gyan Jr., Mark Ballard, Michelle Milhollon, Marsha Shuler, John LaPlante and The Associated Press contributed to this report.

"My mother's not breathing. She's not breathing," Lamar Robinson screamed above the roar of helicopters landing and taking off on what used to be the Causeway Boulevard exit ramp on I-10. "Please, please, God, help us." An emergency medical technician began resuscitating Robinson's mother, Hattie Robinson. Within moments they lifted her stretcher and ran to a helicopter that just landed. "We just got pulled off our roof," Robinson said as tears rolled down the side of his sweaty, dirty face. "It was flooded with 10 feet of water, and we've been there since Monday. I just want my mama to live. Please, God, let her live." Robinson was one of thousands of evacuees who began arriving at this interstate intersection sometime Thursday. Many of them came from the Superdome and others came from rooftops of flooded homes where they've been stranded since Monday. Advertisements About 120 school and commercial buses sat parked and empty 25 miles away at LaPlace. The thwack of helicopter blades signaled the arrival at the evacuation bottleneck of even more residents rescued from rooftops and drop-off points deeper in the disaster area. "I was sleeping on the ground, with my children, in the filth," said Eric Watson of Gretna. Watson said he saw about 20 buses in two days, and his family of five finally boarded one of three buses in a convoy brought in by state Sen. Cleo Fields, D-Baton Rouge, which rescued about 200 people Friday. He stopped at the Causeway and I-10 intersection Friday afternoon with the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who criticized federal leaders for failing to plan and for abandoning the city's poorest residents. The government "knew the storm was coming and they watched as people perished," Jackson told reporters at the overpass. "As many starved to death as were killed by the hurricane." Officers at a Louisiana State Police checkpoint several miles from New Orleans forced several buses to turn around. Only the senator's convoy, emergency vehicles and utility repair trucks were allowed to pass Friday afternoon. The two politicians, who were received at the Metairie overpass with a mix of cheers and criticism by frustrated evacuees, arrived in Baton Rouge with no place to send the evacuees. Plans to take them to Livonia High School fell through, Fields said. Shelters in Baton Rouge are full. Among the rescued was Ryan Francois, a 31-year-old who said he took a neighbor's boat and saved 42 people, including his parents, in the New Orleans East subdivision where he lived. Many of the evacuees on the overpass were children, elderly or sick. "I had to spend the night here on the concrete ground," said Marion Evans. "I'm 78 years old, and I don't know how much more of this I can handle. I have no food, no water. "When we were brought here yesterday, they said we would immediately be put on buses and taken to Texas," Evans added. "But no one has come. I'm hungry and tired. Please help us." No tents, no blankets and no shelter of any kind were available. "We've been treated like cattle," said Delana Coleman. "No human being should be treated like this." As the evacuees, many carrying suitcases filled with their belongings, grew agitated, National Guardsmen armed with M-16 rifles tried to keep them calm. With water, but little food, people in wheelchairs and walkers and others lying on the concrete and on the ground or walking restlessly waited for buses or helicopters for the final leg of their trip. But few buses arrived. Four buses sat in the westbound lane for more than hour, empty. "We don't know where the buses are," said State Tooper Michael Linton, who was helping guard the throngs of people. "They're not here yet." Another trooper said a few buses had arrived, "but they just showed up here on their own." While state troopers and National Guardsmen waited for the buses at the Causeway exit staging area, just miles down the road at a Texaco Gas Station at the LaPlace exit, the school buses and charter buses sat empty and parked, waiting for instructions on where to go. Drivers loaded their buses with food and water to give to their passengers when they finally were able to pick up them up. "We've sent some buses to the Superdome," said Major Derick Ward of the 5th Army in San Antonio, Texas. "They've been steadily going out all day." The evacuees will be taken to Dallas, Houston and to the New Orleans Airport where they will be ferried on military aircraft to other facilities in other states, Ward said. "It's moving, maybe slow, but we're getting it done," Ward said. "We moved 340 buses yesterday and we hope to move 500 buses today." But by nightfall, the buses were still sitting at the LaPlace Texaco gas station and it appeared that few, if any, had moved all day. Several empty buses were seen driving to Baton Rouge. While few buses showed up at the staging area, helicopters did. National Guard and U.S. Coast Guard helicopters were constantly in motion, dropping evacuees off while others picked them up. And no one knew where they were going -- not the police, not the Guardsmen and not the evacuees. Families said they were trying to stay together, some were successful, others were not. "We don't know where we're going," said Debbie Edmund with panic lacing her voice. "I can't find my husband. He was helping some older people at the Superdome and he got left behind. The pilot said he was going back to get him, but what if I can't find him?" Others waiting in line were angry and frustrated. Nearly everyone was hungry. "We've lost everything," said Lisa Mansion. "We were picked up by a boat two days ago from our house, dropped off on the exit ramp at Elysian Fields and left there. The police said someone was coming for us, but no one did. "Some guys with guns showed up the second night and harassed us. I was so scared," Mansion added. "Then last night, we got picked up by a helicopter and brought here. Now, we have no idea where we're going. Can you imagine, living in one place your whole life and not know where you're going?" Most of the evacuees were kept behind crowd control fences while armed National Guardsmen patrolled. The evacuees yelled at anyone who passed by, asking for food or help. "My baby is hungry," said Rick Broadston, 31, of his son, Merlin Broadston, 2. Merlin was not active and emergency medical technicians were trying to find out why he was listless. "Do you think he's going to be OK?" Broadston asked the EMT. "I don't know," said Cindy Fitzgerald, an EMT. Nearby, Pastor Brian Pierce of St. Petersburg, Fla., sat with his head in his hands. "I can't help all of these people," he said. "I've brought enough food for about 1,500, but I'm afraid if I start handing it out, it's going to start a riot. I want to give it to the kids, but I don't know if that's going to work." Pierce said he spent his church's rent money to buy the food. "What I can't understand is where is everybody else," he asked. "I mean, there's no one else here with food but me. Where are they?" As night began to fall, a weary National Guardsman said he was sure most of them will be spending another night here. "It looks like Armageddon," he said. "And it's another night in hell." Printer Friendly Version Send this story to a friend Advertisements FEATURES

As of Friday morning, Chad Theunissen of the American Red Cross said Red Cross shelters in the 10-parish capital area were housing 10,412 evacuees, even though their combined capacity is 9,637. "We're 800 over capacity, and the closest place I know that has a (shelter) vacancy is Shreveport," Theunissen said. Shreveport is about 4 hours from Baton Rouge by car. The number of people at the Red Cross shelters do not include thousands of other evacuees who may be staying with family, friends, volunteers who have taken them in, churches and other social service organizations. Advertisements Theunissen said at one point Thursday night, the Baton Rouge River Center exceeded its capacity of 5,000 as evacuees continued to flow into the capital city. Irma Plummer, assistant chief administrative officer for Mayor-President Kip Holden, said it's important to know where vacancies exist in and around Baton Rouge. "Buses are coming here, and they're wanting to bring people here. We need to be able to tell them where to go instead of just telling them they can't leave people here," Plummer said. Theunnisen said the Red Cross is asking evacuees if they have any family outside of the areas affected by Katrina. "If they have family, we're trying to direct them there," he said. Theunissen said that of the 10,412 evacuees in Red Cross shelters in the 10-parish capital area, 6,251 are in East Baton Rouge Parish. Holden and his chief administrative officer, Walter Monsour, have both indicated that they want Baton Rouge to get out of the shelter business. They want to focus on other demands being placed on city-parish government as Baton Rouge becomes the primary staging area for hurricane rescue and recovery operations. Those services include adequate roads and housing, police protection, airline traffic, building permits and business relocation. Monsour said he is especially concerned about the River Center, which has been near or over its capacity of 5,000 since it opened to evacuees Tuesday. City-parish officials opened the River Center to allow schools that were being used as shelters to prepare to reopen. "We have several businesses that are concerned about the impact of having 5,000 refugees in downtown Baton Rouge. They don't have to be criminals. Just having that many extra people downtown can cause problems," Monsour said. Meanwhile, city-parish officials learned Friday that state officials are looking at the possibility of opening the closed K-Mart store on Airline Highway so that it can be used as a temporary hospital for evacuees with medical needs. Before that announcement, evacuees with medical needs have been sent to the Pete Maravich Assembly Center and the Carl Maddox Field House at LSU, which are both being used as makeshift hospitals. But the demand caused by evacuees is prompting state officials to look at other possible sites for a MASH-type hospital, Monsour said.

The horses are being cared for by LSU Veterinary School students and volunteers at the Lamar-Dixon Expo Center in Gonzales. When she arrived in Baton Rouge on Tuesday night, all Lucy Rogers-Joseph could think about were the 64 horses she left in Kenner. Four were running loose, searching for high ground, and the rest were standing in 2 feet of water, trapped inside their stalls. She had written her telephone number on their harnesses. She assumed they would all drown. Rogers-Joseph had just started a new business, Legacy Stables, in the weeks before Hurricane Katrina hit. She and her family, who lived in the Uptown area, had made the decision to ride out the storm at the stables. But by 4 p.m. on Monday when flooding started, they reluctantly abandoned the animals. "At that time, the mayor (New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin) was saying that the pumps had failed, the levee was breached and everyone had better get out now. They had their hands full dealing with the human situation, which of course, was the right thing to do. "But it broke my heart to leave the horses. I knew there was no way to get help for them. And we had run out of time to get ourselves out of there," she said. Advertisements Although she and her family made Baton Rouge safely, Rogers-Joseph was unable to sleep that night. Another couple had stayed behind in Kenner with their own horses at a nearby stable, and had told her they'd rather kill the horses than watch them suffer and eventually drown. But Rogers-Joseph made them promise to wait a couple of days and give her a chance to send help. Help finally came on Thursday, when several organizations joined together to rescue the horses and deliver them to the Lamar-Dixon Expo Center in Gonzales. Only one horse didn't make it, and Rogers-Joseph assumes that it died before help arrived or was euthanized because it was too ill to make the journey. The rescue effort was coordinated by an alphabet soup of agencies -- the Louisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry, which oversees the Office of the State Veterinarian, the United States Department of Agriculture, which oversees the Office of the Federal Veterinarian, and the Livestock Hauler's Association, which provided 12 trailers to transport the animals. "We sent veterinarians and animal health technicians," said assistant state veterinarian and emergency planner Dr. Martha Littlefield. "Our people revaccinated the animals, checked their feet, fed them and gave them medical care right away." Luck played a part in the rescue, too. "We were able to do this only because so many conditions were right," said Bonnie Clark, who coordinates the horse unit with the Office of the State Veterinarian for the Lamar-Dixon site. "The horses were located just off the interstate so they were easy to get to. The water level was low enough to work in, and the situation didn't present a threat to the rescuers, so we could go in safely." Although the horses had been standing in water for nearly three days, they were in remarkably good shape, Clark said. "I can't say enough about the team that actually went in there and brought them out," she said. "They did an unbelievable job." Littlefield says animal rescues will continue in the coming days and weeks. Her agency and the LSU School of Veterinary Medicine have established a horse hurricane helpline to assist owners with questions regarding rescue, shelter and medical care for their animals. The number is (225) 578-9501. On Friday, equine veterinarian Dr. Ashley Stokes answered the hotline and said the calls have been steady since Katrina hit. She said anyone who can help provide supplies, feed or pasture space should call the hotline as well. "A lot of animals will be lost," Littlefield said. "But there will be many that live and will be displaced . They will need homes, and we'll try to reunite them with their owners." She said her agency is working closely with the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, which has been cooperative on every level. Unfortunately, other humane groups from out of state have come into Louisiana and neglected to get approval from the appropriate state office, making rescue efforts more difficult. Littlefield said owners of small animals can call (225) 578-9900. A phone call to that number Friday instructed evacuees to take their animals to the John M. Parker Coliseum at LSU for temporary shelter. In the meantime, Joseph-Rogers can sleep a little better at night. Her own horses are safe, and she kept her promise to send help for the others. "The people who rescued these animals are my heroes," she said. "I'll be forever grateful." Printer Friendly Version Send this story to a friend Advertisements FEATURES

U.S. Postal Service spokesman Dave Lewin, a consumer affairs official in Houston, said Friday that evacuees should fill out and submit change-of-address forms to get mail delivered soon. "We're recommending they do use change of address forms for any individual who feels they will be displaced for any length of time," Lewin said. "That will allow the evacuees to get their mail much more quickly, and it will allow the Postal Service to move the mail instead of storing it." The ZIP codes affected by the disruption in service are those that begin with the following three numbers: 369, 393, 394, 395, 396, 700, 701 and 704. For example, mail delivery to Meridian, Miss., in ZIP code 36912 is suspended because the first three numbers are 369. The disruption in service applies to letters, magazines and other mailings. Advertisements The Postal Service recommends evacuees, if possible, fill out the form on the Postal Service Web site, http://www.usps.com/. Those without Internet access should call (800) 275-8777. The Postal Service says it can begin redirecting mail to new addresses within 24 hours. Lewin said change-of-address forms would be made available at the larger shelters. Those with no access to telephone or Internet services can submit a change-of-address form by mail. Those forms can be obtained at the nearest post office or at many evacuation shelters. Until change of addresses are filed, New Orleans mail will be diverted to Houston, the U.S. Postal Service said Friday. Mail is being held in trailers and vans in Houston, and the post office will distribute mail as it receives new information on addressees, said Cliff Rucker, district manager for the Postal Service in Houston. In addition, a general-delivery ZIP code -- 77230 -- has been set up for the more than 11,000 refugees at the Astrodome. Astrodome refugees will get mail that has their name, a "general delivery" designation and the special ZIP code. Those staying in other shelters can have mail forwarded to the shelter, he said. Officials said they would prefer for recipients to have identification, and they are working to create some form of ID for refugees who don't have it. Said Lewin: "We've weathered many storms, and this happens to be the granddaddy of them all." Lewin said the Postal Service is also looking to make temporary changes to the way it processes mail in the area. "The processing center is located directly behind the Superdome, and it still has several feet of water in it," Lewin said. In addition to mail delivery problems, Lewin said, the Postal Service has about 6,000 workers in the Gulf Coast area affected by the hurricane and is waiting to hear from most of them. "We want to know, first of all, that they are safe," Lewin said. "We also want to find work for those workers wherever it is they have evacuated to." Postal workers should call (888) 363-7462, and New Orleans area letter carriers should call (225) 923-2963. The Associated Presscontributed to this report.

Assistant Parish Attorney Lea Anne Batson said the exemption for temporary housing is only valid through March 1. She said the council also suspended through March 1 the 30-day limit for living in temporary housing. Batson said the exemption will allow requests for temporary housing to circumvent the city-parish Board of Adjustments and help speed up the permitting process. However, Batson said, applicants will still have to comply with all code requirements, including setbacks, for temporary mobile homes. Councilman Darrell Ourso said the council plans to review how the new exemption is working. At that point, the council may consider making some changes to the temporary exemption, he said. The exemption was requested by Mayor-President Kip Holden, who said it's designed to allow local families to put up displaced friends and family who have evacuated from the New Orleans area in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. Advertisements On Friday, the council also authorized Holden to sign lease agreements to allow one new passenger airline and four cargo airlines to operate out of Baton Rouge Metro Airport. TACA Airlines wants to provide passenger air service to San Salvador and other locations. Cargo airlines looking to fly into Metro Airport include Diplomat Freight Service Inc., DHL, Fedex and Parr Inspections. "We're talking about all the major airline shippers. The idea is to keep an orderly flow of cargo into the area," Holden said. Printer Friendly Version Send this story to a friend Advertisements FEATURES

Time is critical when it comes to food safety, and the loss of power from Hurricane Katrina could endanger food within four hours, cautioned Sharman J. Charles and Sally Soileau with the LSU AgCenter, and Karen M. Stevens with the Southern University AgCenter. Meat, poultry, fish and eggs should always be kept refrigerated, and frozen food kept frozen, if possible, when the power is out, they stressed. If foods thaw and are held above 40 degrees more than two hours, they generally should be discarded, Soileau said. If the temperature is above 90 degrees, food should not sit out for more than an hour. "While the electricity is off, avoid opening the refrigerator and freezer doors unless absolutely necessary," Soileau cautioned. Advertisements A fully stocked freezer will remain frozen for about two days. The fewer the number of items in the freezer, the quicker the freezer will defrost. "In the refrigerator, highly perishable food will usually keep for four to six hours, depending on the kitchen temperature," Soileau said. "If the power will be out longer, ice may be placed in the refrigerator, and block ice will be the most effective." Dry ice can be placed in the freezer, the extension agents said. Thirty pounds of dry ice should hold a full, normal-size freezer below freezing for at least a couple days. Retail sources for dry ice in the Baton Rouge area include Capital Welders Supply Co. Inc., 1101 Choctaw Drive, open 7:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday-Friday. The phone number is (225) 383-3717. Company employee John Ramirez said Capital Welders was out of dry ice Thursday, but was expecting a shipment by Friday morning. Reddy Ice, 1140 Myrtle St., which sells both dry ice and block ice, could not be reached. The phone number is (225) 383-4455. "Never touch dry ice with your bare hands or breathe the fumes," Soileau cautioned. Dry ice can cause burns. Put dry ice in heavy paper or on boards inside the freezer or on top of frozen foods. Allow 2? to 3 pounds of dry ice per cubic foot of space. More dry ice may be needed in an upright freezer because dry ice should be placed on each shelf.

That will disrupt ferry service in the Baton Rouge area. Two ferries will take people from Chalmette across the Mississippi River to Algiers, which was not devastated by the storm. The ferries will carry about 2,500 passengers each, spokeswoman Cleo Allen of the Department of Transportation and Development said. Advertisements Three more ferries were on the way to the New Orleans area Friday, Allen said. To make the ferries available, officials are stopping ferry service at White Castle, Plaquemine, Reserve and St. Francisville. Motorists who use those ferries will have to use all-land routes indefinitely. Tent city springs up near Port Allen Lock PORT ALLEN -- A tent city grew overnight in West Baton Rouge Parish, and with it, rumors grew. The Federal Emergency Management Agency erected air-conditioned tents, field kitchens and shower facilities Thursday and Friday. Word quickly spread that the parish, which is already taking care of almost 900 refugees from Hurricane Katrina, would be assigned 1,500 more. "Not so," Parish President Riley "Peewee" Berthelot said Friday afternoon. The tent city, located on property near the Port Allen Lock owned by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, will house FEMA workers, contract workers and other emergency personnel on assignment to the area. There may be as many as 2,000 people living in the tents at the lock and using it as a base for their work. The parish, with population of 22,000 people, has 409 refugees in a shelter at Port Allen, 304 in Erwinville and 186 in Addis. There are also some refugees in area motels. Sheriff cancels days off; off-duty patrols on hold Col. Greg Phares, chief criminal deputy in the East Baton Rouge Sheriff's Office, said Friday all off-duty patrols are being placed on indefinite hiatus. "At the present time we are not doing extra-duty details," Phares said, adding that all off days for deputies have been canceled. Phares said deputies have been working 12-hour shifts since Monday and the prospect of performing off-duty patrols isn't a reality with the influx of people who have entered the city. "The assets required to enforce the law in Baton Rouge have increased quite a bit in the last 96 hours," Phares said. "Life is not the same in Baton Rouge today as it was this time a week ago. It will be quite some time before it is even close to the same." Waterfowl dinner indefinitely delayed NEW ROADS -- The Pointe Coupee Delta Waterfowl Chapter has indefinitely postponed its dinner scheduled Wednesday because of the focus on relief efforts from Hurricane Katrina. The chapter hopes to reschedule the event for mid-October, and will announce the new date when it is determined. 'Taste of the West' fair postponed in WBR PORT ALLEN -- The West Baton Rouge Chamber of Commerce has postponed its "Taste of the West" taste fair, scheduled for Sept. 15. A new date will be announced later. All tickets already sold will be honored at that time, and tickets will continue to be sold for the new date. For further information, call (225) 383-3140. Closed school prepped to house 40 families MORGANZA -- The closed Morganza High School buildings are being made ready to house 40 families who are refugees from Hurricane Katrina. The school, closed during the Pointe Coupee Parish School Board's budget crisis, will be used so schools can reopen Tuesday. Schools had been closed because Livonia High School was being used as a shelter, and athletic facilities at Pointe Coupee High School were being used for refugees to shower. A spokesman for Superintendent Dan Rawls said utilities have been turned on at another closed school, Labara Elementary, but said it has not been determined if it will be needed to house refugees. Boasso, Marionneaux get barge for supplies State Sens. Walter Boasso and Rob Marionneaux have lined up a barge to bring needed supplies to victims of Hurricane Katrina in St. Bernard Parish. People are asked to deliver bedding, clothes, first aid supplies, medications, water and nonperishable foods to the inland dock on North Line Road at the foot of the I-10 Mississippi River Bridge in Port Allen. The senators ask that the supplies be delivered before 10 a.m. today. A security guard will be stationed at the entrance of North Line Road to direct people to the place where they are to bring the supplies. James LeBlanc is coordinating the barge loading operation. For more information call 342-1660. Jobless applicants get McDonald's treats Many people filing unemployment insurance claims Friday at the Louisiana Department of Labor administration building lobby in Baton Rouge had something to smile about. The LDOL staff on North 23rd Street took up a collection and bought 200 orders of McDonald's hamburgers and French fries for those who waited in line. The department's sites on Plank Road and Wooddale Boulevard will be open from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. today and Sunday to accept unemployment claims and staffers also will be visiting area shelters to do the same work.

The state late Wednesday commandeered school buses across the state to rescue people still stranded in New Orleans. If enough Baton Rouge buses are being used Tuesday, the school system won't have enough to pick up everyone. In a news release late Friday, the school system reported it will alert on Sunday, via automated phone message, families that can't count on buses Tuesday morning. Only enrolled students can start school; the system has yet to decide when displaced students can start. Officials are trying to line up classroom space and additional teachers, many from parishes hit by the storm. Those displaced students, meanwhile, registered Thursday and Friday at shelters, at schools and at school system offices. The system did not release a tally Friday. Advertisements Thousands more displaced students are registering with schools, both public and private, throughout the area. The Diocese of Baton Rouge announced Friday it has received 1,400 applications from New Orleans-area refugees. The private school system, which operates 33 schools in eight parishes, plans to place as many students as it can handle, but will accept only those students who were already attending Catholic schools. Sister Mary Michaeline said the schools and the numbers vary. For instance, St. Michael the Archangel High School, formerly Bishop Sullivan, has added 400 more students and held an orientation for them Friday, she said. Most of these families had already paid their tuition at their original schools. Michaeline said her schools are working to transfer that tuition money. Other fees, she said, are being waived for now. And, she said, many people and organizations have called to help with people who are still short financially. "Money won't stand in the way of helping people," she said. Printer Friendly Version Send this story to a friend Advertisements FEATURES

About 1,400 displaced students have registered at LSU for the fall semester, Chancellor Sean O'Keefe said Friday. The students come from schools such as the University of New Orleans, Loyola University and Tulane University. They are facing prospects for losing at least a semester of class work because of disruptions at their own schools, O'Keefe told a meeting of faculty, students and others on the LSU campus. About 72,000 students at public and private schools are affected. "As challenging as it is, it is a fraction of the challenge they are going through," he said of the visiting students. Advertisements Classes at LSU, which were called off for the past five days, are set to resume on Tuesday. "It's going to be bumpy, it's going to be really bumpy," O'Keefe said. He said the school has not decided whether to extend the fall semester by one week or trim scheduled time off. Officials of Southern University announced Friday that they will enroll as visiting students for the fall semester any student affected by the hurricane. The school will hold a meeting for the displaced at 1 p.m. Sept. 14 in the auditorium of W.W. Stewart Hall. Students will get counseling, advice and general information by school officials. "We are going to get through this challenging situation," said Ed Jackson, interim president of the Southern University System and chancellor of the Baton Rouge campus. Meanwhile, Commissioner of Higher Education Joseph Savoie said the state is taking a wide range of steps to assist displaced students. Information for those students is available at http://www.regents.state.la.us and by calling 1-866-415-2269. The same Web site includes information for faculty and staff. "No one will lose their jobs as a result of this disaster," Savoie told reporters. The overflow of classrooms because of displaced students will create new jobs for faculty and staff, he said. Walter Bumphus, president of the Louisiana Community and Technical College System, said those schools will offer special registration for students forced to change schools because of Hurricane Katrina. Officials of Baton Rouge Community College have revised the school's academic calendar to aid two-year and four-year students affected by the hurricane. A special eight-week session has been created to start on Sept. 26 and the regular eight-week term begins on Oct. 17. Special registration begins on Sunday at the Bienvenue Student Center on campus. Sally Clausen, president of the University of Louisiana System, said those schools are housing about 10,000 displaced students, families and even Entergy Corp. workers. "None of this is going to negatively impact how we serve our students," Clausen said. Southeastern Louisiana University in Hammond, which was set to resume classes on Tuesday, will start on Wednesday or Thursday instead because of electrical problems. Schools closed for the foreseeable future include Loyola University, Dillard University, Tulane University, Delgado Community College, Nunez Community College, the LSU Health Sciences Center and four technical college campuses. First and second-year medical students who attend the LSU Health Sciences Center in New Orleans are set to resume classes on Sept. 26 at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center. Existing schedules will be used for third-year students and new clinics will be added to the list as they become available.

Efforts to get the ill and injured out of the flooded facility in downtown New Orleans were stalled several times over four days when snipers shot at helicopters. Doctors had to ration dwindling supplies of food, water and medicines. Meanwhile, a 1,000-bed field hospital will be opened in north Baton Rouge to handle patients who survived the ordeal. The new hospital is the same property that LSU had just made a deal to purchase for a future outpatient clinic. Fred Cerise, a physician and the secretary of the state Department of Health and Hospitals, shook his head as he recounted how he saw healthy people were evacuated Thursday while patients using ventilators to breathe were shunted aside. An angered Cerise had worked three days tending patients in New Orleans but returned to Baton Rouge on Friday to get the evacuation effort moving. Advertisements The LSU Medical Center of Louisiana at New Orleans, consisting of Charity Hospital and University Hospital, is surrounded by deep water. It is without electricity and water. The toilets don't work. Some employees fed each other intravenously to prevent dehydration. The hospital morgue is full but under water and bodies of dead patients are scattered though the ruined facility, said Don Smithburg, CEO of the LSU hospital system, which oversees the two public hospitals. A total 363 patients, including 28 babies, were moved, he said. Three patients died in transit. Only about 150 staff and students remain trapped in an isolated education building but they will be ferried out this morning, Smithburg said. Hospital staffers found a previously unused passageway between University Hospital and Big Charity. They ferried patients to a staging area, where the sick and injured were loaded onto trucks to cross the street. Patients were wheeled through a Tulane University Hospital to a helicopter landing pad on the roof. The evacuees then were flown to the Louis Armstrong International Airport in Kenner, Cerise said. From there the patients were sent to hospitals around Louisiana and other states. Medical personnel found many of the most-critical patients were too sick to fly and were sent to Baton Rouge instead, Cerise said. "We have this whole medical infrastructure in New Orleans that doesn't exist anymore," Cerise said. "We are creating a whole system of health care for those displaced." The LSU Earl K. Long Medical Center on Airline Highway is rushing to expand its intensive care unit for 16 more patients, he said. Some of the most critically ill patients from New Orleans are going to private hospitals in Baton Rouge. "We've seen between 75 and 100 sent here officially," said Catherine Harrell, spokeswoman for Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center on Essen Lane. "We tend to see the more critically ill patients." Additionally, the Pete Maravich Assembly Center on the LSU campus can care for 200. A 1,000-bed field hospital is being readied in a former Kmart building on Airline Highway to handle less-critical patients who survived the ordeal. LSU reached an agreement last month to purchase that property for use as an outpatient clinic. The hospital will have air conditioning and all other utilities, said Smithburg. Specially trained doctors from Parkland Hospital in Dallas will help start the facility, he said. Mark Ballard of the Capitol news bureau contributed to this story.

At right is U.S. Rep. Charles Boustany, R-Lafayette, who guided Bush through Lafayette's Cajundome on Friday. LAFAYETTE -- While her husband toured coastal cities hit directly by Hurricane Katrina this week, first lady Laura Bush visited the Cajundome Friday to see another facet of the storm's aftermath. Bush said she was pleased by the community's efforts to provide shelter at the Cajundome -- which now houses more than 6,000 evacuees from New Orleans and southeast Louisiana -- as well as in homes and churches. "Some things are going very, very well in Louisiana, and certainly this center is one of them," she said. Bush flew into Lafayette and arrived at the Cajundome shortly after noon Friday, with U.S. Rep. Charles Boustany, R-Lafayette, and Lafayette City-Parish President Joey Durel. "This is Lafayette at its best, this is Louisiana at its best," Boustany said of the work at the shelter in an interview. Bush first visited a section of the Cajundome set aside for evacuees with special medical needs, stopping to speaking with the very old and the very young and speaking with the doctors who are treating them. Next, she stopped to speak to a roomful of Acadiana's American Red Cross volunteers, thanking them for their work and asking about pressing needs. Help with laundry, extra sheets for special-needs patients and personal hygiene products topped the list called out to the First Lady. Other volunteers said thanks should also go out to the evacuees themselves, because they have shown great patience and been cooperative with the people trying to help them. Bush stopped in at a room set up to provide Internet and telephone access for evacuees, meeting with a couple of families there. She asked whether parents waiting there had taken advantage of Lafayette Parish's offer to take displaced children into public schools. Bush said getting those children back to school is important to give them a sense of normalcy and to keep them from falling behind on their education. She finished her visit by joining volunteers in serving lunch to evacuees. "The response is more than adequate here," Bush said of Lafayette. She also said she was glad to see the effort being made by the Lafayette Parish School System to take in students displaced by Katrina. Bush commended efforts to match evacuees with local jobs, as well. She also said Louisiana will not be alone in its effort to rebuild in the wake of the hurricane. Bush said the federal government and businesses from around the country are ready to pitch in to aid the recovery, and that's not all. "A number of countries have offered aid directed at the United States," she said. Asked about reports of mass looting and lawlessness in New Orleans, Bush said the response to date has not been adequate, but she understands why some of the problems are arising. "This is what happens when there is a natural disaster of this sort," she said. The people in the affected area are displaced, scared and frustrated, Bush said. "This is a human reaction to a terrible, terrible disaster," she said. Boustany said Bush's visit had an impact that will be felt by more than just the people with whom she spoke, and would boost morale for the state. "It truly offers comfort and solace to people throughout Louisiana," he said. "It sends the signal that everything that possibly can be done is being done."

CLINTON -- About 50 workers for a Clinton specialty bag manufacturer plan to stay on the job through the Labor Day weekend to fill an order for 500 large sandbags being used to help plug broken New Orleans levees. The bags, made of high-strength polypropylene plastic, are 5 feet wide, 5 feet deep and 8 feet long, said Mark Day, sales manager for PacTec Inc. With 12,000-pound test nylon straps attached, the bags can be stacked with filled sandbags, picked up by a helicopter and lowered into the levee breach. The bags weigh about 12,000 pounds when filled, but can be picked up by a U.S. Army UH-60 Blackhawk helicopter, Day said. The plant specializes in manufacturing a variety of industrial products, including bags used to package low-level radioactive waste and plastic liners for railroad gondola cars that carry the waste to disposal sites, he said. After weathering the storm and waiting to get power restored Tuesday, the plant shifted into high gear to assist in the flood fight in New Orleans. Salesman Brad Wilson said he received a call late Tuesday night from Jerry Edgens of Turner Industries, a contractor for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, inquiring about the availability of bags for its project. By 1 a.m. Wednesday a shipment of 70 bags manufactured for the DOE work left for the Baton Rouge airport, and full production began Thursday on newly designed bags for the levee work, they said.

Lafayette Parish School Superintendent James Easton said his staffers spent Friday afternoon sorting through the registration forms and looking at parish schools to check what free space they might still have available. Easton had said earlier in the week he was hoping to get the students into school by Tuesday but that target date looks unlikely. He said he wants his staffers to start scouting schools to get a feel for where best to place students and to start looking at where students are to plan bus routes and student pickups. That work has pushed the target date back to about Thursday, though that could change, Easton said. Easton said the system has also received about 80 job applications from teachers displaced by the hurricane. He said that his staff is working on how to cover the costs of Hurricane Katrina in the parish budget, in terms of student, teacher and transportation costs. Easton also said that, though the formal registration team is wrapping up its work, the door is not closing on children of displaced families. He said a special School Board meeting may be necessary to sort out some of those issues. Easton said he had not expected the enthusiasm evacuee families would have for the offer to open schools to their children. He said he originally thought the final number would likely be less than 1,000. He said he expects families and students chased from their homes by the hurricane to continue to trickle in.

Donald Songy, assistant school superintendent of Ascension schools, said 574 of those new, temporary students are living with relatives or friends and 168 of the them are staying at the Lamar-Dixon Expo Center in Gonzales, the parish's main American Red Cross shelter. "Now those numbers will probably change next week because we expect people to enroll their kids then too," Songy said. Songy said the 574 students living with friends and family will attend classes at the school in that residence's district. "And there's not any one school where everyone seems to be going. It's all spread out," Songy said. But school officials don't know where the 168 students staying at the shelter will attend class. Songy said there are two options -- either creating some sort of school at the Lamar-Dixon Expo Center or farming the students out to schools all over the parish. "Right now, we just don't know what we are going to do. No plan is finalized. We will know more next week," Songy said. All Ascension Parish students are scheduled to go back to classes Tuesday. The 574 new students already registered at specific schools will begin classes in Ascension Parish the same day. Parents registered their children for school Friday in the front lobby of the YMCA at the Lamar-Dixon Expo Center. Marion Ridgley, 17, of Kenner is a junior at Riverdale High School who is staying with her family at the shelter. Ridgley said she is looking forward to going to school again because she is bored. "You can't go anywhere. I'd rather be in school than sit here and do nothing," Ridgley said. Ridgley said she has been hearing around the shelter that people may have to stay away from their homes for as long as two months. Delia Darby of Kenner registered three of her five children for school in Ascension Friday. Darby said she wasn't very happy with the idea of her children -- ages 10, 11 and 7 -- attending a new school. "I don't think it's a good idea. I have one child that is autistic and one who is emotionally disturbed. I'm not sure a new environment is what's best for my children," Darby said. Songy said that every displaced child coming into the school system who has special needs will have full access to the school system's special education department. When asked why she was registering her children for school, Darby said she was doing it because it's the law. "We have to, right? It's mandatory. I don't want to break the law," Darby said. Songy said that with the added students, the school system will need new teachers -- maybe as many as 40. Songy said the school system fielded a large number of phone calls Friday from displaced teachers looking for work. But Songy said he did not have an exact number. The new students in Ascension Parish come at a bad time. School system officials will be going to parish voters in October to ask for approval of a new property tax and the extension of a property tax to build five new primary schools in the booming parish. Schools are overcrowded with recent reports of more than 800 more students enrolling than last year at this time. "This puts an additional strain on a school system which is already the fastest-growing district in the state," Songy said. But Songy said the school system will meet the challenge and make every child feel welcome and secure. Printer Friendly Version Send this story to a friend Advertisements FEATURES

Providing services to the thousands of evacuees in Lafayette has stressed city resources, and officials say they have had no contact with the Federal Emergency Management Agency on what will become of the more than 6,000 evacuees at the Cajundome. City-Parish President Joey Durel said he understands that the needs of Lafayette are not as "critical" as those in New Orleans and other areas of the Gulf Coast. But Durel said it "blows my mind" that FEMA has yet to establish some presence in Lafayette or some other areas of the state sheltering evacuees. It seems likely that the facility could be full for months, Durel said. Lafayette police and other law-enforcement agencies are running double shifts providing security at the Cajundome, Durel said. The Department of Public Works is starting to supplement the Cajundome staff for cleanup and maintenance because the Cajundome is not designed to hold people longer than a few hours, Durel said. Officials aren't sure what else they can do, or for what costs FEMA will reimburse, Durel said. Earlier this week, Lafayette received word to send its buses. They sent five, but those buses were only loaded with 30 people, Durel said. The next day, Lafayette sent a dozen buses and each came back full, Durel said. The most important priority for Lafayette officials is ensuring the comfort of the people in the Cajundome, Durel said. The next priority is the safety of the evacuees, Durel said. At the same time, city officials have expressed frustration of the continued rumors of rising crime attributed to evacuees. "Unless you have seen a crime yourself, please do not report it," said an exasperated Lafayette Police Chief Randy Hundley, who complained that calls reporting rumors are tying up emergency phone lines. Both Hundley and Lafayette Parish Sheriff Mike Neustrom said the Lafayette area, including the area around the American Red Cross shelter at the Cajundome has seen no upswing in crime. "Security, again, is always a concern, but it is under control," Neustrom said. "We have ample security ? in the neighborhoods around the Cajundome as well as in the Cajundome." The Cajundome is expecting more evacuees, but no official capacity limit has been set, Cajundome Director Greg Davis said. "We are going to accommodate all we can accommodate," Davis said. "We have busloads of people coming. They have been turned away from other shelters. They are in desperate need." Shelters throughout Acadiana have been stretched to capacity, and Davis pleaded with area residents and churches to open up to evacuees. "We have people in here who have been walking in sewage and just need a shower," Davis said. Traffic was heavy and lines at gas stations were occasionally long as Lafayette and surrounding areas dealt with the sudden and unexpected increase in population of thousands who fled Katrina. The real estate market is quickly becoming tight as evacuees search for temporary housing and local oil and gas service companies move in employees from the coast. Many local classified ads are geared specifically toward attracting displaced workers. Margaret Trahan, director of the United Way of Acadiana, urged residents to follow established channels in order to volunteer. Don't just show up somewhere, call first, Trahan said.

Graves said no new shelters will be opening in the parish because of a lack of people to staff them and lack of law-enforcement personnel to guarantee the safety of the parish if more shelters open. He said he has asked churches not to open additional shelters in the parish, because he can't provide security for them. Additional evacuees need to be sent farther west, Graves said. A busload of people sent to Denham Springs by officials in Baton Rouge Thursday night was sent back to Baton Rouge because there was no more room in Denham Springs shelters, Livingston Parish President Mike Grimmer said. Those were people who arrived in Baton Rouge on a commandeered tractor-trailer rig earlier Thursday, he said. Grimmer said that he doesn't know how much longer Livingston might have to continue providing shelter for the evacuees. Graves said he hopes, after talking with state officials Friday, that those sheltered in Livingston Parish can be moved by Tuesday, possibly to Fort Polk, so school can resume. Denham Springs Junior High School is one of the three public shelters operating in the parish. A number of churches also have taken in refugees. The total was about 2,000 Friday afternoon, Grimmer said. Those evacuees are only a small portion of the extra people in the parish either working or living temporarily with friends, relatives or in motels, Grimmer said. Two of the public shelters are within the Denham Springs city limits and the people in those shelters have caused no serious problems, Denham Springs Police Chief Jeff Wesley said Friday. The people staying in the shelters are being cooperative and are very appreciative of the outpouring of help being provided by the people of Denham Springs, Wesley said. Shock is turning to sadness for many of the evacuees who have lost homes and possibly jobs, Wesley said. Wesley said his office has had to spend a lot of time dealing with false reports about problems at the shelters, as well as carjackings, robberies and civil unrest elsewhere in the city. Despite talk to the contrary, crime in Denham Springs is down since the hurricane, Wesley said. There has been no increase in crime in the broader area of Livingston Parish, said Kearney Foster, chief of detectives for the Livingston Parish Sheriff's Office. Grimmer said trucks bearing food, water and ice finally began reaching the parish Friday. Those trucks have all been from private sources, including one from Bass Pro Shops, Grimmer said. Grimmer said the parish was still waiting Friday afternoon for the first truck of supplies from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Luckily, churches have pitched in by preparing meals and providing for other needs of refugees, he said. The shelters have a lot of people with medical issues, including some who need dialysis and more than 25 pregnant women, the parish president said. Two volunteer paramedics arrived in Livingston Parish Friday and a team of doctors will arrive today to help provide care for the people in shelters, he said. Dow Chemical Co. is flying those doctors in from three out-of-state universities, Grimmer said. Workers in the shelters are becoming worn out and anyone who would like to volunteer to help is asked to call (225) 686-3232, he said. Fuel is becoming a serious issue, Grimmer said. Previously many stations couldn't pump gasoline because of a lack of power. Now, stations are running out of fuel, he said. More than 25 percent of the parish remained without power Friday afternoon. Those areas included Springfield, Killian and Maurepas, Grimmer said. Some areas in the southern part of the parish are still having to boil water, he said. Port Vincent Police Chief Norris Hull said things are going well there and slowly getting back to normal. Drinking water is flowing and has been chlorinated, Hull said. Part of the village has regained power, and lines have been long at those places that have gasoline and are able to pump it, Hull said. Bans on burning and on using boats in the Tickfaw and Amite rivers will remain in place at least until Tuesday, Grimmer said.

Clo Fontenot said Friday. Fontenot made the assessment in remarks to mayors, constables and fire chiefs around Livingston Parish during an emergency meeting of the Livingston Parish Council. The good news from the Federal Emergency Management Agency is that it will reimburse local governments for costs incurred for cleanup and securing the health of people for the next 60 days, Fontenot said. Concerns of parish officials ranged from how long evacuees will stay in local shelters, whether FEMA will attempt to set up its tent cities in the parish to security at and surrounding the shelter. Officials said they don't want tent cities of evacuees in their parish because the infrastructure in the parish is already stretched. Five days after the storm -- Friday night -- was the first time Livingston Parish saw any assistance from FEMA. Fontenot told the Parish Council that its legislative representatives told FEMA not to set up trailer cities in the parish except for government workers who need to use Livingston Parish as a staging area to serve the parishes north of New Orleans. The officials concurred with that decision, he said. Two of the water trucks they received came from Ascension Parish, which officials forwarded to Washington Parish, where officials have no means to communicate their need for help, Grimmer said. Once the parish is stabilized, the Livingston Parish officials said they need to help their neighbors in Tangipahoa and Washington parishes who were harder hit by the hurricane. Law enforcement will patrol the shelters and the areas around the shelter, said Sheriff Willie Graves. However, the talk of riots, looting and shootings around the parish simply aren't true, the sheriff said. Printer Friendly Version Send this story to a friend Advertisements FEATURES

The state Department of Environmental Quality is investigating the spill near Venice. DEQ officials believe up to 2 million gallons of oil escaped from the storage facility, said DEQ spokesman Darrin Mann on Friday. The spill has been seen from the air but environmental officials have not been able yet to investigate, Mann said. "Two tanks with the capacity of holding two million barrels appear to be leaking," a DEQ statement said. DEQ officials didn't yet know how much oil had spilled into the Mississippi River and were planning further flyovers to determine the extent of the spill, Mann said. Meanwhile, Plaquemines Parish officials want to blow up part of the flood protection levees that are now keeping much of the developed part of the parish under water. "We want to dynamite the back levees to let the water out" of Louisiana's mostly low-lying parish, said Amos Cormier, president of the Plaquemines Parish Council. The parish consists mostly of marshes that form the delta of the Mississippi River before it flows into the Gulf of Mexico. But the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers wants to cut holes in the levee with earth-moving equipment, Brig. Gen. Robert Crear said. The explosives that Plaquemines officials want to use would create a crater that engineers could not control, Crear said. A controlled dig allows the earth to be replaced more orderly when rising water requires using the levees for protection, he said. Cormier estimated that 20,000 of the parish's 27,000 residents will have to find another place to live. He said everything downriver from Port Sulphur is under water. Cormier said the parish also is requesting 50 military police with heavy weaponry to stop looters who are taking "whatever they can take." The levees ring much of the populated part of the parish to keep out high water during storms. But if the area inside the levees is flooded, the water stays put like milk in a bowl. Cormier said he wants explosives and explosive experts to do the job now but will await the decision by the Corps of Engineers, which controls levees.

Iberia Parish President Will Langlinais said the rumors of carjacking, rapes and robberies are getting well-worn from travel throughout Louisiana. "Just change the name, the same rumors are running rampant," he said. Sheriff Sid Hebert said that while rumors have run of a spread of violence over the past 24 hours, his officers have seen no upswing. He said his officers reported only two crimes that could conceivably be tied to the influx of people -- though he found it unlikely -- a report from a pharmacy that three young men had tried to get medication without a prescription and a robbery on Ann Street. Hebert said the pharmacy incident involved no violence and the Ann Street robbery occurred in an area where such crimes are not uncommon and one that is far removed from where evacuees are sheltering. He said a rumor that his deputies had gone around telling banks to lock their doors unless tellers know the people at the door was false. "New Iberia is not under such a siege," Hebert said. He said the city and parish are as safe as they were before the 360 or so evacuees came earlier in the week to a parish that has about 74,000 residents. "Let's do the percentages, it's extremely small," Hebert said. Printer Friendly Version Send this story to a friend Advertisements FEATURES

Assistant Police Chief Mike Langley said Friday the tags are designed to help about 17 Texas police and county sheriff's deputies quickly identify Sorrento residents without requiring them to show their driver's licenses. "If I didn't do something to identify them, they'd be getting stopped over and over and over," Langley said. The tags are being taped to windshields and bear Police Chief Earl Theriot's signature. Langley said the Texas officers were called in to help control traffic flow through town. Residential streets also have been barricaded so fleeing New Orleans residents can be routed to the major highways that cut through town: Interstate 10, Airline Highway, La. 22 and 70, he said. Langley added the tags are available at the Police Headquarters, 8173 Main St. 8:30 bs check gpe -- 2-line briefheds on each, please to cdslot.to guill, please Edit/mgm Tent city springs up near Port Allen Lock PORT ALLEN -- A tent city grew overnight in West Baton Rouge Parish, and with it, rumors grew. The Federal Emergency Management Agency erected air-conditioned tents, field kitchens and shower facilities Thursday and Friday. Word quickly spread that the parish, which is already taking care of almost 900 refugees from Hurricane Katrina, would be assigned 1,500 more. "Not so," Parish President Riley "Peewee" Berthelot said Friday afternoon. The tent city, located on property near the Port Allen Lock owned by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, will house FEMA workers, contract workers and other emergency personnel on assignment to the area. There may be as many as 2,000 people living in the tents at the lock and using it as a base for their work. The parish, with population of 22,000 people, has 409 refugees in a shelter at Port Allen, 304 in Erwinville and 186 in Addis. There are also some refugees in area motels. Sheriff cancels days off; off-duty patrols on hold Col. Greg Phares, chief criminal deputy in the East Baton Rouge Sheriff's Office, said Friday all off-duty patrols are being placed on indefinite hiatus. "At the present time we are not doing extra-duty details," Phares said, adding that all off days for deputies have been canceled. Phares said deputies have been working 12-hour shifts since Monday and the prospect of performing off-duty patrols isn't a reality with the influx of people who have entered the city. "The assets required to enforce the law in Baton Rouge have increased quite a bit in the last 96 hours," Phares said. "Life is not the same in Baton Rouge today as it was this time a week ago. It will be quite some time before it is even close to the same." Closed school prepped to house 40 families MORGANZA -- The closed Morganza High School buildings are being made ready to house 40 families who are refugees from Hurricane Katrina. The school, closed during the Pointe Coupee Parish School Board's budget crisis, will be used so schools can reopen Tuesday. Schools had been closed because Livonia High School was being used as a shelter, and athletic facilities at Pointe Coupee High School were being used for refugees to shower. A spokesman for Superintendent Dan Rawls said utilities have been turned on at another closed school, Labara Elementary, but said it has not been determined if it will be needed to house refugees. Waterfowl dinner indefinitely delayed NEW ROADS -- The Pointe Coupee Delta Waterfowl Chapter has indefinitely postponed its dinner scheduled Wednesday because of the focus on relief efforts from Hurricane Katrina. The chapter hopes to reschedule the event for mid-October, and will announce the new date when it is determined. 'Taste of the West' fair postponed in WBR PORT ALLEN -- The West Baton Rouge Chamber of Commerce has postponed its "Taste of the West" taste fair, scheduled for Sept. 15. A new date will be announced later. All tickets already sold will be honored at that time, and tickets will continue to be sold for the new date. For further information, call (225) 383-3140.

Ultimate Zydeco Throwdown organizer Cullen Washington said earlier this week that he planned to enforce his contract to hold the event today and suggested the evacuees be moved to nearby schools for the weekend. "I went ahead and decided to cancel it. ? I can't find it in my heart to kick women and children out so people can come have a party," Washington said. Washington estimated that he has lost about $13,000 on marketing and supplies. "I'm still blessed that I can go home tonight. I can take a shower and get in bed," he said. Other zydeco events planned for the festival-heavy Labor Day weekend will go on as scheduled, including: n The Southwest Louisiana Zydeco Music Festival in Plaisance n The Creole Zydeco Festival in St. Martinville. But some festivals have been postponed or canceled in the aftermath of Katrina.Those are: n The Shrimp and Petroleum Festival in Morgan City, re-scheduled for next month n The Rayne Frog Festival has also been postponed. No new date has been set. n The Mamou Cajun Music Festival has been canceled. Meanwhile, plans are coming together for a Katrina relief benefit concert Sept. 10 at Parc International in downtown Lafayette. The lineup has yet to be confirmed. Acadiana Arts Council Executive Director Buddy Palmer said he hopes the benefit concert will raise at least $15,000 for the American Red Cross.

Dave Nussbaum Meteorologistdnussbaum@wbrz.com Friday, September 2, 2005 Click Here for the Latest Tropical Weather Information We had a few thunderstorms pop-up yesterday afternoon, and that could happen once again today.  Also, expect temperatures to climb to the lower 90s, but it will fell more like 100 with the heat index. An area of high pressure has built into the area, and this will lower our chances for rain, but not totally remove them from the forecast for both Baton Rouge and New Orleans.  Scattered thunderstorms developed yesterday over much of New Orleans and that didn't help with the rescue and recover efforts going on down there.  Once again a few storms could pop-up and produce heavy downpours and frequent lightning.  The Labor Day weekend forecast looks to be pretty nice with partly cloudy skies each day and a slight chance for a thunderstorm.  Highs will be in the lower 90s and lows will be near 70 each morning.  The New Orleans area still remains about 80% covered in water, but efforts are underway to fix the breeched levees.  Please do not go down there!  Rescue efforts continue for standed victims today.  For all the latest on the clean-up, recovery and local impacts head to our webpage at www.2theadvocate.com We were fortunate here at WBRZ to team up with WGNO in New Orleans to give you complete coverage of the hurricane from both the Baton Rouge and New Orleans areas.  The Weather 2 Louisiana Team of Pat Shingleton, Chris Stevens and my self worked with WGNO Chief Meteorologist Bruce Katz to bring you up to speed on the track of Katrina.  We will continue to look at the forecast for both Baton Rouge and New Orleans as we have many people who evacuated from New Orleans in town.  We thank those who have sent us emails asking us questions.  We appreciate them, but be sure to watch our newscasts to find out your answers.  Here are some facts about Katrina: Hurricane Katrina made landfall around 6:10 AM between Grand Isle, LA and the Mouth of the Mississippi River with sustained winds of 135 mph, a Category 4 Hurricane.  Widespread flooding was seen across the New Orleans area.  Winds of 100 mph were reported in New Orleans.  The eye went just to the east of the city, over Slidell, and up the Pearl River into Mississippi.  The Mississippi Gulf coast also took a hit from Katrina as they were on the east side of the storm, or the more severe side.  Winds there were estimated to be near 100 mph.  Here in Baton Rouge we had winds gusting from 50 to 70 mph at times.  This knocked down many trees and power lines.  There are many of the residents across the Baton Rouge area still without power this morning, and they could be without power for several days.  ___________________________________________________________TropicsTropical Depression Lee is no longer a tropical system.  Tropical Depression # 14 is still being watched and will likely develop into a tropical storm which will be named Maria over the next day.  This system is located about 990 miles ENE of the Northern Leeward Islands.  There is also a large tropical wave between the Leeward Islands and  the African coast.  This system has not changed much overnight and could still  become a tropical depression over the next 24 to 48 hours.  Otherwise...Tropical Storm formation is not expected through Saturday.____________________________________________________________Here is an updated list of the storms that are predicted to occur this season.  Note that the numbers have been raised due to the rapid start to the season:                                          NHC Prediction       Dr. Gray       So FarNamed Storms:            18-21               20            12Hurricanes:                    9-11               10             4Major Hurricanes:          5-7                 6              3 Click here to read the press release.   Email the WBRZ Weather Team at weather@wbrz.com.

I forwarded the information to The Advocate and you'll have the details in another section of the paper. Many, many years ago and long before the technological ability to assess flooding, officials would dynamite the levees. This occurred in 1927 and since the storm's landfall on Monday morning and its exit from our state that afternoon, water in the affected parishes has exited in Jefferson Parish. For the first time since 1927, the Army Corps of Engineers, working in conjunction with numerous contractors will begin levee breaches soon. In St. Bernard Parish this will assist the flow of water into Lake Borgne. In Orleans Parish the pumps will finally be activated to further bring the city levels down while sheet pilings will plug the leak in the 17th Street canal. Here in Baton Rouge we have the luxury of reducing the pressure on the Mississippi River by opening control structures if needed.

Toll-free hotlines and Web sites are springing up from organizations trying to reassemble the dispersion of New Orleans professionals. The Chamber of Greater Baton Rouge is launching a Web site this weekend to help out: http://www.findyourneworleansemployer.com, which can also be accessed by a link on the Chamber's site at http:// www.brchamber.org. "I think the way it will work is that a business from New Orleans would go in and enter its information. It would leave space for a message and post current contact information," said chamber president and chief executive officer Stephen Moret. "If you've got Internet access, you would go in and type 'Exxon' or 'Hibernia' and it would pull it up." Moret said his staff also will track queries for heavily searched businesses. If the businesses are not listed, the chamber staff will try to locate the company's representatives. "It's for people who normally get paid by paper check or people that don't know if they have a job," he said. "Businesses are having trouble finding their employees." The chamber also has a link on its Web site to track available commercial space for companies that relocate temporarily. Longer term, the state Department of Economic Development is coordinating with its agencies around the state to inventory available buildings and housing. "We expect that companies will be relocated, but we also expect that they will return," said DED Secretary Mike Olivier. "What makes those companies are their employees. Many companies are going to take different paths, obviously." With the Louisiana Association of Business and Industry, the state's largest business lobbying organization, DED also will survey businesses in affected areas, asking them what they need to get back on track and match that to what the other parishes can offer, Olivier said. The clearing house will be available on its Access Louisiana Web site, http://access.louisiana.gov. "We're asking the locals to be prepared to offer assistance on housing," he said. "The Web site will have what kind of buildings are available, and we're adding more to it." Hot line phone numbers Here's a partial list of employers affected by the hurricane and the hotline number they've set up to communicate with their scattered employees. More of the numbers, being sorted from among hundreds of e-mails received by The Advocate, will be published next week.

This will help ease customer demands in regions hit hardest by Hurricane Katrina, the company said. Meanwhile, the United States and European nations said they will tap oil and gasoline stockpiles for 2 million barrels a day, hoping to stem growing gasoline shortages because of disruptions from Hurricane Katrina that have caused fuel prices to soar and some gas stations to run dry. Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman said as part of the emergency release approved Friday by the Paris-based International Energy Agency the United States will release 30 million barrels of crude from its Strategic Petroleum Reserve Other IEA members will provide another 30 million barrels, mostly in refined gasoline over a 30-day period. The announcement brought some relief in soaring crude and wholesale gasoline prices. The cost of crude oil dropped 1.90 cents a barrel to $67.57 and wholesale gasoline declined by 23 cents a gallon to $2.19 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Bodman said the Strategic Petroleum Reserve oil will be put up for bid next week with the first deliveries in 11 to 14 days. He said he had received indications from other IEA members that a significant part of their portion would be refined products, mostly gasoline, which will be released and find their way to the U.S. markets. The U.S. Department of Energy has approved ExxonMobil's request for a loan of up to 6 million barrels of oil from the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve to help ExxonMobil gain access to additional crude supplies at Baton Rouge. Over the past several days the company has coordinated with governments, industry and utilities to restore power to industry pipelines and Mississippi River marine transportation so that crude can be delivered to the refinery. Increasing production at ExxonMobil's Baton Rouge refinery should have significant positive impacts to customers. The next step is to work with industry to restore pipeline transportation to increase product supplies in areas affected by the hurricane. The effort has been stymied because of the outage of the Colonial and Plantation Pipeline systems. Plantation Pipeline is now reportedly open at near full capacity. In the aftermath of the hurricane, demand at the company's Exxon and Mobil stations has nearly doubled, the company said. The refining situation improved further as Entergy, the electric utility at the center of the hurricane impact zone, reported it had restored electricity to all but three refineries in the New Orleans area. But three others, with combined production of 562,000 barrels a day, are still without power. The Energy Department said the Marathon refinery at Garyville, and the Chevron Texaco refinery at Pascagoula, Miss., were resuming operation. The decision by the 26-member IEA to make available emergency crude and gasoline stocks came after days of discussions among agency members including the United States. Bodman called the release an "initial" step and indicated more supplies might be made available if needed after the initial 30-day period. "We have made it known that we are facing shortfalls in available supplies of refined products in our country as a consequence of this storm," Bodman said. He said that addressing the U.S. crude and gasoline supply problem "will stabilize energy markets worldwide." Still, the immediately available supply of energy for automobiles, homes and airlines in East Coast and Midwest markets tightened. Some 1.8 million barrels a day of U.S. refining capacity remained shut down and it will be weeks before the extra gasoline from Europe arrives. Pump prices were above $3 a gallon in many places and motorists have been urged to conserve fuel by everyone from President Bush to Exxon Mobil Corp. Jeff Miller, who owns 50 gasoline stations across southeastern Virginia, said it will be a real challenge over the Labor Day holiday weekend to prevent pumps from running dry from time to time. "Every morning, I'm sitting down, figuring out which stations have product and which don't, then dropping off loads to keep at least some gas at all of them," Miller said. On Friday, four of his stations were empty and demand was holding steady at the others despite prices averaging $3.10 a gallon. Sonja Hubbard, chief executive of E-Z Mart Stores Inc., which owns 319 gasoline stations across Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas, said 10 percent of her stores were experiencing temporary shortages at any given moment. "It will be a busy weekend," said Hubbard. "My entire management team will be working." Despite tight supplies, the panic buying that had struck some markets appears to have settled down. The long lines seen midweek at downtown Atlanta gas stations were gone by Friday, though some pumps were still closed. The IEA agreement will put more than 60 million barrels of oil equivalent on the market over the next month, with the U.S. government portion amounting to at least 30 million barrels of crude oil from its strategic reserve. But the market was most upbeat about the announcement from the 26-nation IEA because it will bring gasoline and diesel from Europe to the U.S. market, where supplies of refined products are shrinking due to Katrina-related refinery and pipeline troubles. U.S. gasoline production is down by about 40 million gallons a day, or 10 percent of consumption, and it could be weeks before the region's refining capacity is back to normal, analysts said. Locating workers and getting them back on the job will also take time. Another area of uncertainty is just how much damage was sustained to the underwater network of pipelines in the Gulf of Mexico that carry oil and natural gas to onshore facilities. The U.S. federal Minerals Management Service said 88 percent of oil output in the Gulf of Mexico remained offline, while 72 percent of natural-gas production was shut-in. Total lost oil output since Aug. 26 was 8.8 million barrels and total gas production lost was 49 billion cubic feet. Hurricane Katrina damaged or displaced an estimated 58 Gulf of Mexico oil platforms and drilling rigs, according to the American Petroleum Institute. Among those, 30 rigs and platforms have been reported lost. Printer Friendly Version Send this story to a friend Advertisements FEATURES

J.H. Campbell Jr., president and chief executive officer of Associated Grocers in Baton Rouge, said the biggest issue facing his company now is dealing with the profound population shift in its market area. In the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, Associated Grocers saw more than 100 of its 250 member stores closed. More than 200 are now open. Campbell said the remaining closed stores are in the New Orleans area and the Mississippi-Alabama Gulf Coast. While the company is hampered by spotty cell-phone service, truck and fuel shortages, and power outages, the biggest hassle is shifting its distribution to account for burgeoning population centers such as Baton Rouge and Lafayette. "We've had a population shift to higher ground," he said, noting the overall demand for the company didn't increase. The usually predictable case-counts and product mixes in stores have changed, and it will take a week or two for today's high demand for certain items -- ice, water and processed foods easily consumed in a crisis situation -- to work its way back to producers. Bakeries, for example, would never have a lot of extra bread lying around that wasn't needed, and will need a little time to catch up. "I don't think food is scarce," he said. "I don't think that's the reality." Supermarkets and other retailers are working to meet customer demand for basic products. Rick Case, manager of the Super Wal-Mart store on O'Neal Lane, said that the store, located near I-12, has gone from being "pretty much a neighborhood store to being a metro store," serving customers from outlying areas, with, currently, limited access to retailers. On Thursday afternoon, for instance, the Wal-Mart store in Hammond was still down, but planning to reopen hopefully on Friday, said Case, and shoppers were driving in from that area. The O'Neal Wal-Mart store usually gets its inventory from a distribution center in Robert, near Hammond, Case said. But this week, it's been getting inventory from Wal-Mart distribution centers as far away as Atlanta; Clarksdale, Ark.; and Temple, Texas, to help it keep up with customer demand, Case said. Wal-Mart delivery trucks typically come throughout the day, every day, but now they're just coming more often -- even though they're fighting heavier traffic to get to the various Wal-Mart stores, Case said. Snacks, water, bread, tuna, batteries and paper products are still being bought in quantities, Case said. And ice -- there never seems to be enough ice, given that some power outages continue. "We can get a truck (of ice) a day and it's gone in an hour," Case said. Jim Parker, a partner in an Ice House America sub-distributorship, which operates ice vending machines in Port Allen and Plaquemine, said the machines "can't keep up." Parker and his business partner Steve Starnes also provide maintenance and service for two ice-vending machines in Baton Rouge -- on Jones Creek Road and on Perkins Road -- both of which have been in heavy demand. The local machines are owned by Louisiana Ice House Distributors. Hicks, one of the partners in that company, said that its Ice House machine at Perkins Road and South Acadian will possibly be turned over temporarily to the State Police to use as they see fit. Hicks said he was contacted by the State Police on Thursday about the temporary dedication of the machine for law enforcement use. His company is prepared to take the machine out of retail use for the immediate future and turn it over to the State Police and is waiting for more information, Hicks said on Friday. Parker believes that, overall, there will be a high demand for ice for perhaps another month. People in this area who are sheltering relatives from out of town "might have 10 people staying at their houses. Even with the power on, they can't put enough stuff in their refrigerators," Parker said. And people staying in area hotels want ice for their ice chests, he said. "When the power went out, Sunday, Monday and Tuesday was just chaos" at the ice machines, Parker said. Louisiana Ice House Distributors lowered the price on a bag of ice from $1.25 to an even $1 at their Jones Creek location, Parker said, just to help things go faster. So many people were lining up for ice that it made a difference if they just had to put in a dollar, instead of adding the quarter, he said. The company will probably keep the lower price for a while, until things get more settled, Parker said. The machines are operating three or four hours each day before running out of ice, he said. "What happens when (the machine) runs out, it puts itself out of service. We have to reset it," to make some more, Parker said. This week, the machines -- normally operating at any time of day -- are delivering ice, beginning at 8 a.m. each day, Parker said. "They run out at noon ? we're not making a killing," he said. "We're only selling a couple hundred bags a day (at each machine). The beauty of it is, at least we've got some (for customers) every day," Parker said.

Entry 7: An eight-day trek through Markha Valley Trekking is simply a long walk over several days or weeks, usually with the support of porters or pack animals to carry food and camping equipment. Over eight days, Rhadd Hunt and I trekked a portion of the Markha River Valley, south of Leh. We had a very adept team of two Tibetans, Chewtar and Raptsul. The older of the pair, Chewtar led our trek, and Raptsul guided our four horses and a mule loaded with supplies. Our tent was set up, and hot tea and a wholesome dinner awaited us at the end of each day's walk. They served breakfast and tea tent-side in the mornings, gave us a boxed lunch before each day's hike, and boiled all the water we drank. Our trek started Aug. 1 at Spitok. After several hours of walking through flat desert landscape to the base of the mountains, we started to ascend. Raptsul, a 25-year-old Tibetan working on a master's degree in philosophy, didn't know the trail very well. We made a wrong turn and hiked an hour and a half up a gorge to nowhere. We turned back, retraced our steps, and in a short while were at our campsite leaning back, drinking tea. The entire walk was only 4.5 hours, so Rhadd and I made no complaints about the wrong turn. Chewtar, however, admonished Raptsul for quite a while. Nothing like that happened again. We continued our ascent the next morning after Chewtar gave Raptsul a detailed description of the day's route, full of exclamations and hand gestures. We passed above the tree line by noon, and after five hours of hiking, we camped within sight of Ganda La Pass (16,000 feet). It was windy and cool at the high altitude. Nomads drove huge herds of sheep and goats past our camp in search of pasture as we passed the evening playing cards under the stars. The next morning we hiked over Ganda La Pass. The air was so thin I couldn't walk more than 20 feet before stopping to catch my breath - and all I was carrying was three bottles of water and a small lunch. The view from the pass of the Zanskar and Himalayan ranges was spectacular. From there we descended, finally reaching the Markha River after five hours. Along the way I spotted a rabbit, several pheasants and a few yak. Total walking time for the day was 7.5 hours. The trek along Markha Valley was beautiful, as well as comfortable since the trail was relatively flat, though we walked upriver so we were slightly ascending. There are ancient monasteries, mani walls (walls made of stones carved with Buddhist prayers) and stupas (large stone urns of important Lamas) throughout the valley. We reached our destination for the day, the town of Markha, after eight hours. Markha is a small village with a school, Buddhist monastery and an elaborate irrigation system for farming, but no road access or electricity. The school has an enrollment of 24 children. The following day Rhadd and I were exhausted during the 7-hour hike. We had gained considerable altitude in two days, and our campsite was once again cold and windy. I slept outside until it started raining early in the morning. Rhadd starting feeling ill the sixth day of our trek. After five hours of hiking in windy and frigid conditions, we reached Nimiling, a small nomad encampment at 16,200 feet. Rhadd had chills and looked horrible, so our guides covered him with blankets from the horses (our tent smelled accordingly), and changed out hot water bottles for several hours. It snowed furiously as the evening approached, and Rhadd began to vomit. The morning light brought no relief. Our initial itinerary called for a break at Nimiling for the day, but Rhadd insisted that we move to a lower altitude where it would be warmer. Considering the weather and Rhadd's condition, we all agreed. Our guides put him on one of the horses, and we started our ascent up to Konmaru La Pass (16,900 feet). After another spectacular view - this time of the Indus Valley and Ladakh Range - we began to descend. Rhadd had to walk for several hours in the beginning of the descent since the horse was prone to slipping on the very steep, loose shale trail. He had a difficult time, and we made slow progress until he was able to ride again. After seven hours we made it to Sumdo, a somewhat-developed settlement with electricity and dirt road access. It was also warm, and Rhadd started to feel better. On the last day of our trek, we hiked - and Rhadd rode - three hours along the dirt road to Hemis. Raptsul had a taxi waiting for us, and we are now in the oasis of Leh, where there are beds, toilets and electricity (sometimes). It's the small things in life that bring the greatest pleasure! Entry 6: Tibetan culture and Buddhist monasteries Ladakh, Zanskar and the Lahaul and Spiti valleys are distinctly Tibetan in their cultural makeup and have had close ties to Tibet and Tibetan Buddhism for more than a thousand years. Fortunately, they were considered Indian territories when China took over Tibet around 1950, sparing them the cultural destruction that has taken place in much of Tibet. By the 1970s, China razed almost every monastery in Tibet (most of the ones you see now are rebuilt), and has been systematically replacing traditional Tibetan Buddhism with a politicized version tailored to pacify the Tibetan people and accommodate the tourist industry. Thus, Ladakh and the surrounding regions are the last living strongholds of Tibetan culture and tradition. The Dalai Lama visits often and has a residence outside of Leh. Leh once was the capital of the Ladakh Kingdom, and a now-defunct royal palace built around 1600 is a reminder of the town's past. Leh is now a bustling little city (population 28,100) that caters to the escalating influx of tourists. Hotels, restaurants, Internet cafes, Tibetan crafts shops and adventure tours dominate the local economy. Electricity runs only in the mornings and evenings, but some businesses run small generators during the day. Upon arrival to the city of Leh, Rhadd Hunt and I checked into a cozy hotel with connections for every type of adventure tour. We spent the day rafting on the Indus River. Our guide navigated us into the biggest rapids, some of which swallowed our raft whole and spit us out vertically! A few days after rafting in Leh, we traveled 70 miles north, a five-hour drive by Jeep, to the Nubra Valley. The road went over Khardungla pass at 18,380 feet (almost 3.5 miles), making it the highest road in the world. Also known as the Valley of Flowers, the Nubra Valley has a lot of well vegetated settlements at points where snowmelt streams descend from the mountains, in stark contrast to the surrounding dry barren landscape. We found a hotel in the largest settlement in the valley, Diskit (population 1,000), and later that evening visited the local 500-year-old monastery. North of Diskit is a large expanse of desert, and the next morning Rhadd and I took a short camel ride through the dunes. We spent the rest of the day traveling to various monasteries before reaching Panamik, the furthest our "inner-line" permits would allow, and the furthest north in India that a foreigner can travel. We returned to Diskit for the evening, and the following day returned to Leh. Tomorrow we start a nine-day, 70-mile trek through Markha Valley, south of Leh. Entry 5: Through the Himalayas Rhadd Hunt and I left Manali, India, in a private Jeep on July 18. Though more expensive ($100 each) than the bus ($15 each), a Jeep would be worth the added comfort and convenience for the three-day ride to Leh. The first leg of our trip ascended into mountains blanketed with extensive pine forests intermixed with a seemingly endless number of waterfalls. Narrow, potted switchbacks brought us higher until the trees fell away to barren rock. Rohtang Pass (elevation 13,000 feet, or 2.4 miles) was the first and lowest of three passes we crossed on our way to Leh. There was road construction along the pass with a motley crew of thin, sunken-eyed Indians mostly from the south, judging from their dark complexion. It's amazing that they could work in such high altitude. At one point the crew was simply throwing stones into the road, creating a jagged carpet for vehicles to traverse through, and in the process, crush. Our Jeep stalled while crossing this obstacle course, and I saw another get stuck. A few hours later we arrived at Keylong. Keylong (elevation 11,000 feet) is the capital of Lahaul and Spiti (population 30,820). Though I couldn't find a population statistic for Keylong, I would say it is less than 3,000. We spent two nights in this sleepy Himalayan town and enjoyed the quiet, "Shangri La" atmosphere. We hiked to several Gompas, or Buddhists temples, which winded us tremendously, but also helped us acclimatize to the altitude. The two Buddhist sects in the region are Kagyu and Gelukpa, headed by the Karmapa and Dalai Lama, respectfully, with each holding fort on opposite sides of the valley. Keylong is off the tourist circuit, and we were the only customers in our four-story hotel, much to the dismay of the Nepalese staff. Nepal is currently in a state of civil war, and the staff had traveled from western Nepal to Keylong in hopes of earning money. One worker told me his goal was to save enough money over the summer to put a tin roof over his family's home, worth about $200. With no tourists, he was very sad. We tipped them well. We left Keylong with the thought that it was an undervalued location and hoped to visit it again on our return trip. Our journey continued upward through Baralacha La Pass (elevation 16,000 feet) and then down into the plains of Sarchu, the only overnight stop between Keylong and Leh. Sarchu consists of a series of tent camps spread out along the valley. Rhadd and I had a fun spending the afternoon hiking along the plains, checking out the river valley. The next day was grueling. The first six of eight hours to Leh was some of the roughest road I had ever encountered. My head is sore from hitting the roof of the Jeep countless times. We passed over Taglang La pass (elevation 17,500 feet), the second highest road in the world. The land was barren, and as we blazed across the high plains there were nomads on the side of the road begging for water. Rhadd gave them a half bottle. Finally, we made it to Leh (elevation 11,500 feet). Rhadd was extremely nauseous, and my internal organs needed rest. We found a hotel, and are now planning a rafting trip down the Indus River and a camel trek across the high desert. Entry 4: The bus ride to Manali The bus ride from Dharamsala to Manali took nine hours, starting at 8:30 p.m. We barreled down narrow roads at top speed with precipitous cliffs at every outside turn. The bus was shaking so hard the scenery became cartoon-like, and the ride nauseous. Around 2 a.m., the driver and his companion sealed up the front driver compartment and smoked hashish. It was easier to keep my eyes closed for most of the trip north along the Kullu Valley. We arrived in Manali as first light touched the Himalayas, high above the Himachal Pradesh. Manali is the last major settlement in the Kullu Valley, elevation 1.27 miles, population less than 5,000. Manali means "home of Manu," and legend has it that Manu, the Noah of Hinduism, stepped off a boat in Manali to recreate life after floods had devastated the world. Most of the bottled water in northern India comes from here. Ironically, flooding has been a major problem getting to and from Manali, as the road we came in on reopened the day before we arrived. This place is gorgeous - small villages nestle into an alpine landscape, large rivers gush out of every valley, and the Himalayas high above strike different poses throughout the day. We took a taxi to Vashisht, a little village northeast of Manali, and booked a room with a view for $10 a night. We met a pair of snake charmers who had a spitting cobra among a dozen other snakes. They encouraged us to handle the other snakes while they seduced the cobra with flutes, but I took pictures instead. The next day we hiked up the valley to some magnificent waterfalls. Unfortunately, illness took hold again. Rhadd contracted a stomach virus, which he transferred to me within a day and a half. We had planned to leave Manali after a few days, but we have been here a week and may stay a few more days until we are ready for the 6-hour bus ride to Keylong. Entry 3: The Dalai Lama's 70th Birthday Bash His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, is the political and third-highest spiritual leader of the Tibetan people. The Karmapa and Penchen Lama are the first- and second-highest spiritual leaders, respectfully. Tenzin Gyatso was born July 6, 1935, in a small village in northeastern Tibet. Born to a peasant family, His Holiness was recognized at age two, in accordance with Tibetan tradition, as the reincarnation of his predecessor the 13th Dalai Lama. In 1950, at 16, His Holiness was called upon to assume full political power when Tibet was threatened by China. In 1959, he was forced into exile after the Chinese military occupation of Tibet, the beginning of a military campaign that has taken over 1.2 million Tibetan lives (out of a population of 4 million) and has destroyed more than 6,000 temples and religious sites. Since 1960, the Dalai Lama has resided in Dharamsala, India, where the seat of the Tibetan Government in Exile was established. The actual headquarters of the Tibetan Government in Exile is about 2.5 miles above Dharamsala at Gangche Kyishong. The Dalai Lama's residence is farther up the mountain at McLeod Ganj (elevation one mile). Currently there are approximately 250,000 Tibetan refugees living in the region. The Dalai Lama's birthday is a traditional day of celebration, and his 70th this year was no different. The main festivities were held at the Tsuglagkhang complex, which comprises the official residence of the Dalai Lama, the main temple and the museum Namgyal Gompa. I came late due to a torrential downpour, which turned out to be the beginning of the monsoon season. It hasn't stopped raining since. There were masses of Tibetans and foreigners being turned away by security guards. Luckily, I had visited the complex the day before and noticed a series of passages underneath the complex that led to dormitories and other areas. I slipped into one of the passages and worked my way through the dank labyrinth to emerge in the midst of a troop of Tibetan musicians in traditional costumes. They, nor the security guard armed with a submachine gun, took no notice of me. After a few minutes I ducked and entered the main complex. I was in! There were several thousand monks and several hundred foreigners swarming around. I could hear the Dalai Lama speaking from the main courtyard, and there were video screens set up in every available corner broadcasting his speech. After the Dalai Lama had finished speaking, the rest of the day was filled with traditional Tibetan music and dancing, intermixed with an occasional comedy skit. Most of the Tibetans were dressed in traditional costume, and everyone seemed to be having a grand time. "Long Live the Dalai Lama" was the mantra of the day. Entry 2: Journey to Dharamsala Our 4-hour flight to Mumbai (formally Bombay), India, left Kuala Lumpur at 6 p.m., arriving at the Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport at 8:30 p.m. local time. The next flight to Delhi didn't leave until 3:40 a.m., so Rhadd Hunt and I took an excursion across the city for a bite to eat. Our taxi was an old Fiat that had been modified to run on natural gas. Mumbai is a city of 16.4 million people and is the major industrial hub of India, as well as the home of Bollywood, where most of the films of India are produced. It is also home to Asia's largest slums. This was very evident to us as we traversed through the city and caught sight of people living in squalor for the entire duration of the 40-minute drive. What struck me as different from the homeless in the United States was that these people seemed to have been living this way for generations. Entire extended families were sleeping in the open, or under a few ragged tarps. Entire communities were located under overpasses. Children played in filthy mud puddles, women prostituted themselves, and cripples knuckled along on 2x2 pieces of plywood with rollers underneath. It was steaming hot, even in the evening, and I can only imagine that disease would fester in such conditions. We made our way back to the airport by midnight and waited in exceptionally uncomfortable chairs for our next flight. A slight cough that I had picked up in Malaysia started to worsen, and I realized I was running a fever. By the time we landed in Delhi, I was definitely sick. From the airport we took a taxi to the Interstate Bus Terminal, purchased tickets for the 12-hour ride to Dharamsala, then found an air-conditioned room for the day. There is a heat wave sweeping India, with temperatures as high as 113 degrees in Delhi. I stayed in all day, battling fever and gut-wrenching coughing fits. There is also an epidemic of meningitis in Delhi, but luckily I had been vaccinated prior to leaving. I forced myself to eat a few bananas and took some Ibuprofen before loading onto the bus. The road to Dharamsala is a rough one, with only half its length being paved. Since its monsoon season, the unpaved sections of road were gutted and filled with potholes. As we ascended into the mountains, the road become progressively windier, which didn't stop the driver from driving at top speed. Several people vomited. Finally we arrived at Dharamsala with the morning light. Needless to say, my condition hadn't improved. We found a hotel room just down the road from the Dalai Lama's residence and booked it for five days. I walked to a traditional Tibetan physician who said to me, "Ibuprofen good, drink only hot liquids, no cold, and don't worry." I followed her advise, and my fever broke yesterday. The Dalai Lama's birthday is in a few days with lots of festivities planned. Entry 1: First stop -- Malaysia Greetings from hot and steamy Malaysia! This place makes Louisiana seem comfortable. After a 30-hour flight with layovers in Houston, Seattle and Taipei, I landed at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport. Rhadd Hunt, a Baton Rouge native who has been in Malaysia since December, met me there. Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia's commercial and political capital, is a city of 1.4 million people with a downtown that boasts the second-highest building in the world, the twin Petronas Towers. That evening, we ate at the Hakka food bazaar, where all types of exotic Asian cuisine are offered. I had swordfish, some sort of noodle dish and a Carlsberg beer - all for less than $4. The next day, we visited Batu Caves, a Hindu shrine a short drive from Kuala Lumpur. Monkeys scurry freely up and down the 272 steps to the limestone cave entrance, vying for handouts and sometimes harassing visitors. The cave's main area is nearly the size of a football field. Elaborately painted sculptures of various Hindu gods line the periphery and walls, some with steps scrolling up for the faithful to follow and leave offerings. The statues are arranged to tell parables from the Bhagavad Gita and other Hindu scriptures. Each year in late January or early February, almost a million pilgrims come to the caves during the Thaipusam festival to participate in masochistic feats rich in body piercing and scarification. Tomorrow we leave for India.

"The scope of this tragedy is becoming more evident as time passes, and LSU's focus is on assisting in the recovery effort of our state," said LSU chancellor Sean O'Keefe. "LSU is a primary evacuation site and we are not going to conduct any activities that could deter from our mission of assisting in the recovery mission." "The events of yesterday and this morning have made it clear that this is not the time to play a football game," said LSU athletics director Skip Bertman. "This is a dire situation that rivals any in the history of our state, and our priorities are on participating in recovery efforts." A number of locations on the LSU campus, and athletics facilities in particular, are being used in the recovery efforts for Hurricane Katrina. The Carl Maddox Field House is a Special Needs Shelter and the Pete Maravich Assembly Center has been designated as a triage unit for medical emergencies. The Bernie Moore Track will be utilized as a helicopter landing site for medical emergencies. In addition, the traffic resulting from a football game could seriously impede the movement of emergency medical vehicles coming from the New Orleans area. Advertisement The rescheduled date will be determined by the two schools and an announcement is expected within the next 36 to 48 hours on the planned date.

"We have been in contact with the administrators for both universities and we all agree that the focus of our attention should be on the continued safety of the student-athletes, coaches and the lives of those affected by this storm," Banowsky said in a news release posted on the official Conference USA Web site. "Playing a football game is not our highest priority at this time." The game has been moved to Saturday, Nov. 26, one week after both teams were scheduled to complete their regular seasons. ESPN2 was scheduled to air the game nationally and the network has indicated that it will attempt to show the game on November 26 at a time to be determined.

He is also the anchor of News 2 Louisiana at noon. Todd is from Mandeville, Louisiana, where he attended Mandeville High School. He received his education degree from the University of New Orleans in secondary speech. Todd's dad brought home a video camera one-day and his passion for the business quickly grew. However, he feared a full-fledged career in television might not work out, so he majored in education. Todd was a student teacher at Ben Franklin High School in Metairie, Louisiana. To this day, education remains a passion for Todd. "I love to teach," says Todd. "And I hope that passion translates on television. The audience should wake up every morning and learn something new. That's our job." Todd's career in television began in New Orleans. He worked as an associate sports producer for WWL-TV. He then moved to WSFA-TV in Montgomery, Alabama where he became a sports reporter. He covered the World Series in Atlanta, the Super Bowl in New Orleans and SEC football. He then switched gears to become a feature reporter where he won several awards. From 1997-1999, he won the Associated Press' Best Feature Story. He was also named Best Specialized Reporter two years in a row. In 2000, Todd had an opportunity to return to Louisiana. "This wonderful state is home. You never realize how much you miss Louisiana, until you leave." Todd says. "My wife, Jennifer, and I are from the same town and it's such a blessing for both of us to be back home with family and friends." When Todd isn't at work, he's probably dabbling in photography. He enjoys every aspect of the hobby and loves the beautiful landscape of Louisiana, which provides an incredible backdrop. But he doesn't have to go far from home for a photo-worthy subject. Todd and his wife Jennifer have a daughter, Abby Jane, and a son, Blake Charles, born in February of 2005. They also have "another daughter," Sydney, their female boxer. Todd and his wife are active members of First United Methodist Church in Baton Rouge. Advertisement FEATURES

After Hurricane Katrina, he found shelter from the storm for two days and nights in, of all places, the Baton Rouge apartment of LSU quarterback JaMarcus Russell. Saints to play home opener at Giants Stadium After suffering through days of uncertainty regarding the fate of their hurricane-ravaged city, at least the New Orleans Saints know where they're going to play their first three regular-season games. Tulane will have football this fall They haven't quite figured out how yet, but Tulane is going to play football this season. Students are being allowed to enroll in "nine of the leading higher education associations," according to a statement from Tulane President Scott Cowen. That means the school's athletes will also be able to play sports this fall. Breaux Bridge tops Lafayette Coming into the season, Lafayette High School coach Mark Barousse said it was imperative for his Lions to get off to a good start. LSU plans to play on home field Tiger Stadium will remain eerily quiet today, the first Saturday of the 2005 season. LSU volleyball team defeats Georgia State to stay unbeaten Overcoming the trauma caused by the disaster of Hurricane Katrina in southern Louisiana earlier this week, the LSU volleyball team beat Georgia Southern, 30-21, 28-30, 30-18, 30-15 on Friday in the first day of the Georgia State Invitational at the Hanner Fieldhouse. Notre Dame defense lives up to billing There's plenty of truth in advertising when it comes to Notre Dame of Crowley's defense. Acadiana blanks Northside, 15-0 Using a defense that defused the explosiveness of top-ranked Northside, Acadiana High opened the season Friday night with a 15-0 victory. St. John's Willis glad to be able to play Westminster St. John of Plaquemine football coach Erik Willis didn't expect Week 1 of the high school football season to be like this. Opelousas Catholic holds off Loreauville Opelousas Catholic jumped out to a 21-0 halftime lead and held on to take a 21-14 victory over Loreauville in a non-district game that helped open the 2005 football season for Louisiana High School Athletic Association teams. Mickles: Unkindest cuts coming for Saints in San Antonio In light of what's happened in the past week, it's kind of cruel to think that the New Orleans Saints will have to release 19 players from its roster today. Young Cajuns OL braces for Texas Greg Hodges and Brandon Cox are 620 combined pounds of offensive linemen who might have to display their maternal sides at kickoff time today at Darrell Royal-Texas Memorial Stadium. SLU, Nicholls State look to return to field Southeastern Louisiana will likely return to the football field next week, but would do so a few days later than scheduled.

155	Server: Netscape-Enterprise/2.01 Date: Sun, 04 Sep 2005 00:07:09 GMT Content-type: text/html ::: 2theadvocate.com presents -- Football 2K5 ::: Mr. Saturday Night Just a few short months ago, Les Miles accepted an offer to become the King of Louisiana Saturday Night, taking on the monumental yet irresistible challenge to become the 32nd football coach at LSU. Plenty wonder if he?s the man to continue Nick Saban?s legacy of success. Those people don?t include Les Miles. Tigers won't sneak up on anyone Arizona State, Appalachian State to visit Columns: Scott Rabalais | Sam King Tigers won't sneak up on anyone There it is, on LSU's highlight video from 2003, the BCS national championship season. Nick Saban, before the first game of his fourth year as coach of the Tigers, told his players they had a chance to do something special in the months ahead of them. LSU's Niswanger studious, curious Before a test, students have been known, from time to time, to secretly and illicitly scribble the answers to anticipated questions on their hands, taking the easy way out. LSU guard Nate Livings said he's seen teammate Rudy Niswanger do the opposite. Curious by nature, studious to a fault, Niswanger wants to be a doctor. He's not sure what kind, but he said he knows medicine is the place for him and his exploratory mind. LSU's Williams makes presence felt Some day very soon, Kyle Williams could be a busy man on Sunday afternoons. For now, the LSU senior has better things to do on the Sabbath. Williams, a 6-foot-2, 295-pound defensive tackle, devotes six days a week to LSU football. SEC West: LSU appears to top list Sitting down to write this column, I was joined by a little devil on one shoulder and tiny angel on the other. Right away, the devil chimes in, "You're a hometown sportswriter. You can't really predict LSU to be the best team in the SEC West Division again, can you?" SEC West Capsules SEC East: UF's Leak makes difference Eleven times in the 13 seasons of divisional play in the Southeastern Conference, the Eastern Division champion has been either Florida or Tennessee. SEC East Capsules Rose marks end, or beginning, of era In 2005, the entire college football season shapes up as a Run for the Rose Bowl, this year's ultimate game -- and ultimately the end of an era of sorts. AP College Football Page Jaguars seek complete effort for title The prevailing motivation for this season's Southern University football team is it recalls the team's failure to close out its last two games. The Jaguars led the Bayou Classic and then the SWAC Championship Game in the fourth quarter and lost both. Schiefelbein: SWAC finally has it right Jaguars call on new quarterback Once more, the time has come to introduce a new Southern University quarterback, the school's seemingly annual rite of fall. Meet sophomore J.C. Lewis. Wouldn't it be nice to have the same guy back next year, too? Eugene's back, just like Grambling Grambling's back. For proof, there's no need to consider much more than the return of quarterback Bruce Eugene. And with Eugene comes considerable swagger. UL-Lafayette hopes for winning season LAFAYETTE -- The operative words during the Rickey Bustle era at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette have been close, closer and closest. The Ragin' Cajuns managed to take that to another extreme last season and in the process extended the school's longest losing streak. Of the 24 losses during Bustle's tenure, 11 have been by seven points or less with six those coming by fewer than five points. Ricard to make Tulane go NEW ORLEANS -- In the last year, Lester Ricard has gone from a rusty, neophyte college quarterback to a record-setting one and the unquestioned leader of Tulane's offense. Ricard was redshirted as a freshman at LSU in 2002 and sat out 2003 after transferring to Tulane. That left him nearly three years removed from his final game at Amite High School. Louisiana Tech hopes to reclaim glory Louisiana Tech football coach Jack Bicknell realizes the grievous mistake he made six years ago. Bicknell won the conference in his first season. He did it again two years later, guiding Louisiana Tech to a Western Athletic Conference championship and Humanitarian Bowl appearance. Since then, the Bulldogs have endured some rough times in the last three years. ULM holds high 2005 expectations The University of Louisiana at Monroe finished last season with five victories in its last seven games. For a program that hasn't enjoyed a winning season since 1993, the Indians' 5-6 record -- their best in five years -- nearly qualifies as a breakthrough. Zachary native Huggins draws raves at SLU And to think: When Felton Huggins enrolled at Southeastern Louisiana University, he wasn't even planning to play football. Had to be coaxed -- begged, almost -- by those who knew him. Now, he's glad they did. Lions fans certainly agree. In two seasons, the Zachary native has rewritten SLU's receiving records. He already is the school's career leader in touchdown receptions (18) and second in receiving yards (1,830) and receptions (116). McNeese tries to rebound from losing 2005 LAKE CHARLES -- The top line on the front of the T-shirt is, in reality, the bottom line at McNeese State: Get Back the Swagger. At an early-August practice, a football manager walked the sidelines with the message across his chest. Below it was another strong statement about some of the goals the Cowboys will bring into this season: Payback Tour 2005. The back of the shirt listed the itinerary -- the game-by-game schedule. NW State motivated for title run One of Scott Stoker's most vivid 2004 memories is a somber postseason team meeting. North Texas still team to beat in SBC Nicholls handles adversity, now looking for wins NWSU favored, but SLC could be up for grabs Armstrong confident LC can challenge The carousel of coaches continued in 2005 for Louisiana College, but the Wildcats are looking to continue a more positive trend -- improvement. LC, which revived football for the 2000 season, has either improved or equaled its win total every year from the previous year, culminating with a 5-5 season in 2004. With their third head coach in two years, continuing that trend might prove to be difficult, but not impossible. Saints have sunny outlook for season METAIRIE -- There's hardly a Saints player who doesn't remember the roller coaster of emotions of the 2004 season. Sheldon Mickles | NFC | AFC Saints' Horn not your average Joe METAIRIE -- Wherever he goes, four-time Pro Bowl wide receiver Joe Horn is remembered for pulling out a cell phone. The stunt got Horn a tongue-lashing from his coach, a stiff fine from the NFL and more cell phone jokes than he could ever imagine on national sports shows. But, as family and friends who are close to Horn already know, he should be remembered for much more than his on-field antics. What you see is not always what you get. Outfitting, supporting teams don't come cheap Fans attending high school football games often view those teams and their games as being the less-expensive alternative to college and pro teams. What they really see is a product that still costs thousands of dollars. Scotlandville and St. Michael the Archangel have larger budget burdens than normal.. Fambrough: Classification rule shuffles landscape Trio heads talented recruiting crop Three diverse players. Three different classifications. Three varying opinions. A season after East St. John High School quarterback Ryan Perrilloux was regarded as Louisiana's top prospect and among the nation's best quarterbacks, there's less certainty on the subject this year. That has evoked spirited debate and some emotion as well. Catholic, St. Amant top 3-5A picks Like the Green Bay Packers and Chicago Bears, Catholic and St. Amant share a football identity. Three-way battle looms for 4-5A crown District Capsules: 3-5A | 4-5A East St. John, Thibodaux open at top Hahnville, along with River Parish rivals Destrehan and East St. John, are part of the new 5-5A. District Capsules: 5-5A | 6-5A Acadiana appears to be 2-5A leader Could this be the year where tradition is abandoned in District 2-5A? That's a possible scenario as perennial contenders Barbe and Carencro have young teams. District 2-5A Capsules Breaux Bridge heads close 5-4A race In the 2004 playoffs, three teams from the district advanced to the quarterfinal round, two played one another in the semifinals and Northside High played for the championship.

After Hurricane Katrina, he found shelter from the storm for two days and nights in, of all places, the Baton Rouge apartment of LSU quarterback JaMarcus Russell. While the world wondered if the music legend had become yet another of Katrina's victims, Russell was running to an all-night pharmacy at 2 a.m. to fetch medicine for the man who sang "Walkin' to New Orleans." Friday, just before Domino prepared to leave, Russell made a phone call to LSU sports information director Michael Bonnette. "I want to tell you something," Russell told Bonnette. "Fats Domino's here." "What did you say?" Bonnette asked incredulously. "Yeah, Fats Domino has been staying with me for two days.

By SCOTT RABALAIS srabalais@theadvocate.com Advocate sportswriter Photo by Stephen Franz/courtesy of LSU Sports Information LSU quarterback JaMarcus Russell, left, shakes hands with New Orleans music legend Fats Domino in Baton Rouge on Friday. After being rescued from his hurricane-ravaged home Monday, Domino had been reunited with family members at Russell's apartment. Fats Domino once sang that he found his thrill on Blueberry Hill. After Hurricane Katrina, he found shelter from the storm for two days and nights in, of all places, the Baton Rouge apartment of LSU quarterback JaMarcus Russell. While the world wondered if the music legend had become yet another of Katrina's victims, Russell was running to an all-night pharmacy at 2 a.m. to fetch medicine for the man who sang "Walkin' to New Orleans." Friday, just before Domino prepared to leave, Russell made a phone call to LSU sports information director Michael Bonnette. "I want to tell you something," Russell told Bonnette. "Fats Domino's here." Advertisement "What did you say?" Bonnette asked incredulously. "Yeah, Fats Domino has been staying with me for two days. We're trying to keep it under wraps, but we wanted to let people know he was safe and here." Domino, 77, rarely left his home recently in New Orleans' working class Lower Ninth Ward, the neighborhood where he grew up. After the hurricane struck Monday and heavily flooded the area, Domino's Nashville, Tenn., based agent feared the worst. Eventually, word trickled out that the Rock and Roll Hall of Famer was alive. But his whereabouts were unknown, even to his daughter, who caught a glimpse of her famous father in a newspaper photograph. Before Domino left Russell's apartment complex, Bonnette and LSU athletic department photographer Steve Franz hurried over to get a picture of the Rock and Roll Hall of Famer and the young man widely expected to be the Tigers' starting quarterback -- whenever the Tigers start the season. Bonnette asked Domino how he got out and made it to Baton Rouge. "He was like everyone else," Bonnette said. "He was rescued by boat from the balcony of his home on the second floor. He was taken to the Superdome like everyone else. Then waited on a bus and was taken to the PMAC." Registering under his given name, Antoine Domino, he was processed through the medical triage unit at the Pete Maravich Assembly Center. Russell, like many other LSU athletes, volunteered at the PMAC. His girlfriend is related to Domino, though Bonnette said he didn't known how exactly. Soon, Domino and some of his other relatives were among 20 people packing Russell's Highland Road apartment. Domino, like most everyone else there, whiled away the hours watching Hurricane Katrina coverage or finding some place to sleep on the floor, or a couch or a bed. Not that there was much sleep to be had. Russell said through Bonnette that he was exhausted, even before participating in an evening practice session Friday in Tiger Stadium. "The important thing is that Fats and his family are all all right," Russell said through a university news release. "I'm not sure where they are headed, but I just feel better knowing that they are OK." Friday afternoon, Domino and his family piled into three cars and headed off, not exactly knowing where, Bonnette said. Ain't that a shame. "Tell the people of New Orleans that I'm safe," Domino told Bonnette before he hit the road. "I wish I was able to still be there with them, but I hope to see them soon. "I want to express my sincere gratitude and appreciation to JaMarcus for opening up and sharing his home with us." Notes LSU's indoor football practice facility was pressed into service beginning Friday as a makeshift hospital for storm victims. In addition to the PMAC, victims are being treated at the Carl Maddox Field House and the Bernie Moore Track Stadium is being used as a helipad ferrying in the sick and injured. ? The last pieces of the west upper deck in Tiger Stadium were lowered into place Friday. Much work remains to complete the club levels, press box and infrastructure in the $60 million addition. ? The Tigers will practice today instead of playing their season opener with North Texas, likely postponed until Oct. 29. The team will take Sunday off then begin game week preparations.

Draftees NFC | AFC Preseason Regular Season National TV Weekly NFL NFC | AFC 2004 Season 2004 Results Saints to play home opener at Giants Stadium Rest of 2005 schedule undecided By SHELDON MICKLES smickles@theadvocate.com Advocate sportswriter Associated Press photo New Orleans Saints offensive lineman Jammal Brown bows his head during pregame ceremonies Friday in Oakland, Calif. The Saints and Oakland Raiders honored the victims of Hurricane Katrina before the game. After suffering through days of uncertainty regarding the fate of their hurricane-ravaged city, at least the New Orleans Saints know where they're going to play their first three regular-season games. The Saints, whose season opener will be played Sept. 11 at Carolina, will travel to Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., to face the New York Giants in their "home" opener the weekend of Sept. 17-19, NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said Friday. The New York Jets, who also play in Giants Stadium, have a home date with the Miami Dolphins on Sept. 18, so the Saints and Giants would likely meet on Monday, Sept. 19. After that, the Saints have a road game against the Minnesota Vikings on Sept. 25. Tagliabue said the league was still working out the many details of the Giants game -- including the exact date, kickoff time and TV coverage. He said ticket information will be announced by the Giants in a few days. In making the announcement, Tagliabue said the focus should be on the massive relief effort under way in New Orleans, Mississippi and Alabama, which were slammed by Hurricane Katrina on Monday. Advertisement "Our nation has experienced an unprecedented natural disaster, and we join everyone now in focusing our attention on the massive relief and recovery needs of the Gulf Coast region," Tagliabue said. No announcement was made concerning the Saints' seven other games originally scheduled for the Superdome. The next "home" game after the Giants is Oct. 2 against the Buffalo Bills. Tagliabue didn't rule out playing at LSU, Shreveport's Independence Stadium, Houston's Reliant Stadium or the Alamodome in San Antonio, where the Saints will practice next week as they continue working toward the season opener. "There are many reasons for this decision," Tagliabue said of choosing Giants Stadium, "including recognizing that the overwhelming priority for public and private resources in Louisiana and the Gulf Coast region in the weeks ahead must be the essential needs of the public and restoration of the area's infrastructure." It became apparent when Katrina severely damaged the roof of the Superdome, which was also used as a shelter for tens of thousands of evacuees, and flooded the city that the team likely wouldn't play any games there this season. Like Tagliabue, Saints owner Tom Benson expressed concern Friday for the victims of the disaster. "Our main concern is with the people of Louisiana and the Gulf Coast region who have experienced the recent tragedy," Benson said in a statement. "We are attempting to carry on in these difficult times and are looking out for the best interest of our coaches, staff,? players and their families. My prayers are with each of those who have been adversely impacted." Tagliabue said the game with the Giants will be "presented with elements that will highlight and contribute to the national relief effort." He said the Saints and Giants will donate a portion of the game's proceeds to hurricane relief. "The Saints represent Louisiana and New Orleans, and we will work closely with public officials there to maintain a focus on the region's needs and the role of the NFL and Saints in the recovery," Tagliabue said. The NFL pledged $1 million to the relief effort on Wednesday and John Mara, the Giants executive vice president and chief operating officer, said the game will allow his organization to help even more. "We think the league's decision to move the game with the Saints to Giants Stadium will allow us an even greater opportunity to contribute," Mara said. "We are working with the league, the NJSEA (New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority) and the Saints on a ticket policy for the game, and we will have an announcement on that early next week."

They haven't quite figured out how yet, but Tulane is going to play football this season. Students are being allowed to enroll in "nine of the leading higher education associations," according to a statement from Tulane President Scott Cowen. That means the school's athletes will also be able to play sports this fall. "We're playing ball," said Scott Sidwell, Tulane's associate athletic director. "Now it's up to us to make it happen." Athletic Director Rick Dickson and Conference USA commissioner Britton Banowsky began discussing contingency plans for Tulane after the team forced to leave New Orleans because of Hurricane Katrina. The duo flew to Houston on Friday and met with Cowen. "Until 4 p.m. on Friday," Dickson said, "we didn't know the answer if we could compete in our sports programs." Advertisement But a decision was made to get Tulane students in classrooms, and that meant football players, too. The team is currently staying in Dallas, as guests of Southern Methodist University. "We want our athletes to carry the torch, face, and name of Tulane University during this difficult time," Cowen said. "Logistics have not even been tackled," said Dickson, who will remain in Houston for weekend meetings. "The first priority between now and next week is to make a decision of where to place the team and to get them in class." The Green Wave's first game will be Sept. 17 against Mississippi State. It is yet to be determined whether the game, originally scheduled for New Orleans, will be played in Starkville, Miss., or in Tulane's future "home." But the players just want to play. "We need this season," Wave quarterback Lester Ricard said. "I think that will be the ultimate joy, to see us do well this season." "It's something that we want to do for New Orleans," Wave linebacker Antonio Mason said. "A lot of people look at us as not only reps of Tulane, but of New Orleans. People can look at us and say, wow, look at that team they're going on the road, going through all that adversity, and still getting the job done."

197	 Home Page Main Sports Football 2K5 Preps Index Star of Stars Postponements Rankings Capital City Swim League Baseball Basketball Bowling Cross Country Golf Gymnastics Soccer Softball Star of Stars Swimming Tennis Track and Field Volleyball Wrestling Latest Column Past 14 Days Breaux Bridge tops Lafayette Tigers turn fumble recovery into game-winning TD By BRIAN HUDGINS Special to The Advocate LAFAYETTE -- Coming into the season, Lafayette High School coach Mark Barousse said it was imperative for his Lions to get off to a good start. Just when it looked like that was a certainty, a bouncing ball and a speedy John Williams said otherwise. Williams scooped up a Lafayette fumble forced by strong safety Josh Jordan and sprinted 78 yards to the end zone to give Breaux Bridge a 27-20 win in the season opener for both squads. "I was just hoping to pick the ball up so we could get a drive," Williams said. "This is big for us." Breaux Bridge coach Mike Mowad said the quick turnaround was vital for his group. Advertisement "Hopefully our kids will grow up and come together," Mowad said. "We are a young team. If we played Lafayette 10 more times, I bet we might win one of those." It appeared that Lafayette held all the cards early, as the Lions raced out to a 10-0 lead by the end of a first quarter thanks to a 7-yard touchdown run by Joby Hills and a 26-yard field goal courtesy of Grant Guidry. BBHS, however, narrowed the gap quickly in the second quarter when Darrell Solomon picked up a fumble and returned it 63 yards. It was a momentum change that eventually slowed the Lafayette offense. Lions quarterback Michael McIver completed 4-of-5 passes in the first half for 100 yards, but mistakes haunted the Lions late. "We knew play action would be pretty good and we hit them over the top," McIver said. "We played our game plan and it worked. But we made mistakes by the goal line. We have to eliminate those if we want to be successful." After the Lions had taken their 10-7 advantage to the locker room, the lead changed hands a few times in a matter of minutes. Williams found Logan Guidry with a deep pass that hit the receiver in stride and put Breaux Bridge on top for the first time at 13-10 with just less 10 minutes left in the third quarter. But the Lions answered in a couple of plays. McIver hooked up with Mike Cook and Cullen Crochet on a couple of passes that covered practically the entire field. Rick Griffin scored on a 5-yard run to make it 17-13. Williams kept Breaux Bridge on track though when he took the snap and scooted around left end for an 84-yard scoring?run. "John Williams was special tonight," Mowad said. "What's killing us is having to play him both ways, but we're not going to take him out on defense. Williams said the workload the Tigers handle during the week makes the game more relaxing. "It's hard work running the ball and working on our blocking schemes (in practice). After that, this is the fun part," he said. Printer Friendly Version Send this story to a friend Advertisement Copyright © 2005 2theAdvocate.com, The Advocate, WBRZ. All Rights Reserved.

Home Page Main SportsFootball2K5 LSU Sports Flashbacks Schedule 2005 Signees 2006 Commits Schedule | TV Standings Rankings Schedule Standings Rankings NCAA Indoor Schedule MEN Schedule WOMEN Schedule Soccer Volleyball Advertisements LSU plans to play on home field School hopes to make decision soon for ASU By RANDY ROSETTA rrosetta@theadvocate.com Advocate sportswriter Tiger Stadium will remain eerily quiet today, the first Saturday of the 2005 season. That circumstance was created when the LSU football team's scheduled season opener against North Texas was postponed in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. Whether the mammoth stadium roars to life a week from now is still being debated as the new season kicks into high gear elsewhere. LSU officials remained adamant Friday that they plan to host No. 20-ranked Arizona State on Sept. 10. The No. 5 Tigers and Sun Devils are scheduled to kick off at 7:45 p.m. that day with ESPN slated to broadcast the game nationally. Advertisement That's still the plan, but there's also some wiggle room as LSU officials weigh whether the state is ready for some football after surviving a week of heartache, tragedy and death. "Right now we're doing everything we'd normally do to get ready for a game," LSU spokesman Herb Vincent said. "But nothing in our world is 100 percent for sure. We're playing the situation day by day." Whether that process involves seeking permission from any governmental entity to play the game as planned was unclear. Vincent said most of the communication between the university and city, state and federal agencies has been focused on the ongoing recovery and relief effort on campus and around the city and parish and not whether to play a football game. But there's a sense that LSU would like a green light before proceeding. "We want the recovery and relief process to continue and to get our arms around those things before we go ahead," LSU Athletic Director Skip Bertman said. "We think it would be good to play the game here, but we would like the governor's approval." As it stands, the only clear-cut logistical hurdles LSU might have to scale are securing hotel rooms for the ESPN television crew and making sure there is enough security and traffic control personnel to staff a game. Walter Monsour, Baton Rouge Mayor-President Kip Holden's chief administrative officer, said the university does not need permission from the city to proceed with a game. However, with city police and East Baton Rouge Parish sheriff officers needed to assist with the hurricane relief effort, LSU might have to arrange for its own security force from law enforcement agencies from outside the immediate area. If those details are handled, that may then leave LSU officials figuring out what ethical and moral balance they need to reach before playing a football game with a triage area and makeshift morgue next door at the Pete Maravich Assembly Center and military helicopters flying in and out of Bennie Moore Stadium with sick and injured evacuees. "Right now there are a lot of things going on right here on our campus that we have to consider," Vincent said. "We have some great challenges between now and next week to overcome." If those challenges are met, though, the LSU administrators seem to think the game could be a rallying point for the state. "We think there's a tremendous value to the people of Louisiana -- at the right time -- to play a football game to help bring the people together, and that's why we're working hard to get it done," Vincent said. "We're hearing from more and more people that they're ready for something good to happen." Added Bertman, "We think sports can offer the kind of medicine we need to lift people up in tough times like these. There's a right time to do that and we need to decide if this is the right time." And Bertman is steadfastly holding on to hope that Tiger Stadium is the right place. He and Vincent both discounted the notion of simply moving the game to Arizona State's 71,706 Sun Devil Stadium in Tempe, Ariz. Another option could be to shift the game to either the Independence Bowl in Shreveport -- the state's third-largest football facility with a capacity of 50,000 -- or Cajun Field in Lafayette. "We really haven't ruled anything out yet," Bertman said when asked if he had contacted anyone in the state about moving the game. "We're more focused on seeing if we can get ready to play the game on our campus." If the Sept. 10 game is played at Tiger Stadium, Arizona State has offered to return most of the 5,000 tickets that fans purchased and asked that they be donated to hurricane relief workers. Most Sun Devils fans will not make the trip because of the hurricane and its impact on Baton Rouge, according to an ASU spokesman. Wherever the game is played, Vincent said he thinks it won't capture only the state's attention. "We think this is going to be much bigger than a football game," Vincent said. "It's on national TV, and people are going to watch this game to see how our team is going to represent the whole state." Meanwhile, LSU and North Texas inched closer to rescheduling their game. The Tigers and Mean Green are "working together" to arrange a game on Oct. 29, which is the latest open date on LSU's schedule. To do that, Louisiana-Monroe and Louisiana-Lafayette will likely have to juggle their schedules. North Texas is scheduled to host ULM on that date, but a possible scenario could be for the Indians and Mean Green to move their game to Nov. 19, which would prompt ULM to shuffle its season finale against the Cajuns to Nov. 26. ULM opened its season Thursday night, while ULL left Friday for Austin, Texas, where the Ragin' Cajuns will face No. 2 Texas tonight. "We haven't been able to finalize anything but we're close," LSU associate athletic director Dan Radakovich said. "We had hoped everybody would've been on board and be contacted by (Friday), but we haven't talked to everybody yet."

200	 Home Page Main Sports Football 2K5 Preps Index Star of Stars Postponements Rankings Capital City Swim League Baseball Basketball Bowling Cross Country Golf Gymnastics Soccer Softball Star of Stars Swimming Tennis Track and Field Volleyball Wrestling Latest Column Past 14 Days Notre Dame defense lives up to billing By WILLIAM WEATHERS wweathers@theadvocate.com Advocate sportswriter LAFAYETTE -- There's plenty of truth in advertising when it comes to Notre Dame of Crowley's defense. However, the Pioneers might have actually exceeded their advanced billing. Senior strong safety David Hensgens' interception return for a touchdown was one of three defensive scores, a statistic that went a long way in leading top-ranked Notre Dame to a 40-3 victory Friday over Teurlings Catholic at Clark Field. "I thought our defense just smothered them and made life real tough for them,'' Notre Dame coach Lewis Cook said. Notre Dame, which is scheduled to host No. 2 Redemptorist next Friday, turned a 14-3 halftime lead into the Pioneers biggest margin of victory over Teurlings in 17 years. Advertisement Hengens returned his second interception with 4:27 left in the third quarter and linebacker Lance Meche returned Notre Dame's third interception of sophomore quarterback Taylor Dugas 32 yards on the first play of the fourth quarter to fuel a span of 33 unanswered points -- capped by Greg Savoy' 51-yard fumble return with four seconds left. "I was just in the right spot,'' said Hensgens, who finished with four tackles and also blocked a punt. "I got lucky right there. They set up a great wall for me and it was wide open.'' Notre Dame's defense, which returned seven starters from last year's state runner-up team, limited Teurlings to 56 total yards on 56 plays and forced five turnovers. The Pioneers held the Rebels to no gain or negative yardage 18 times. Junior defensive end Stephen Hundley finished eight tackles. "We just couldn't move the football against them,'' Teurlings coach Sonny Charpentier said. "We just couldn't get anything going offensively and we were worried about that going in. We tried to do some things and we had a couple of opportunities. We've got young kids sprinkled in there. It's a tough christening.'' Notre Dame opened the second half with its longest scoring drive of the game -- a seven-play, 56-yard march -- that running back Scotty Francis capped with a 2-yard run over the right side at the 8:50 mark. Francis, who didn't carry in the final quarter, led Notre Dame with 108 yards and two touchdowns on 20 carries. "They did a lot of moving around which gave us a little bit of problems that we needed to adjust to,'' Cook said. "They start seven seniors on defense, but only two played last year. They're more mature on their defense so I knew they would fight us pretty good defensively.'' Notre Dame drove 44 yards and 25 yards for both of its first-half touchdowns for a 14-3 halftime lead. Hensgens set up both of the Pioneers scoring drives with a leaping interception on the third play of the game. He came back late in the second quarter with a blocked punt. "It wasn't a call,'' Hensgens said of the block. "Everybody else was going to make a return wall and I was just going to go. I got past the guy and got my hand on it.'' Francis took care of the majority of Notre Dame's opening drive, carrying on four of the five plays, finishing off the 44-yard possession with a 3-yard scoring run at the 9:56 mark. Teurlings took advantage of a 13-yard punt one series later, taking over at Notre Dame's 23. But the Rebels couldn't get any closer than the Pioneers' 5 after Elliott Hebert was stopped after a 1-yard gain, forcing the Rebels to settle for Spencer Ortego's 22-yard field goal with 3:37 left in the opening quarter. Teurlings also began second-quarter drives at Notre Dame's 31 after a blocked punt by Jordan Miller and at midfield following a fumble recovery from strong safety Jordy Dugas, but failed to produce point on either possession. The Rebels went four-and-out after Miller's punt block, including three incompletions, and didn't gain a yard after Dugas' fumble recovery and was forced to punt. Hensgens' blocked punt, which was recovered at Teurlings' 25, resulted in a five-play drive that reserve running back Drake Kelly finished with a 6-yard run with 3:46 left before halftime after Francis went to the sideline for a breather. "Against a team like that you've got to get touchdowns,'' Charpentier said. "But you have to give them credit. They've got seven starters that have been there in their third year starting and two years in the dome. They've got an outstanding football team, especially defensively.''

Acadiana, voted the No. 8 team in the Louisiana Sports Writers Association's Class 5A poll, held the Vikings to 160 yards total offense and also retrieved four turnovers. Northside was ranked No. 1 in the first Class 4A poll. "This wasn't very pretty offensively, but defensively I thought we played a great game by playing hard and by playing smart," Acadiana coach Ted Davidson said. "We took advantage of turnovers and we didn't have any penalties on offense. We also were able to hold on to the ball and used that to control the game." All of the Acadiana scoring came in the first half. Advertisement The Rams opened the game with a 95-yard kickoff return by running back James Armstrong and two series later made it 9-0 when Drew Alleman ended a 76-yard drive by kicking a 30-yard field goal. In the second quarter, Garrett Theriot's fumble recovery at the Northside 16 set up the game's final touchdown. Two plays later, running back Darrius Eaglin ran 6 yards with 3:49 left to put Acadiana ahead 15-0. The Acadiana defense got two pass interceptions from defensive back Cory Dugas. Dugas' first interception ended a Northside drive on the Acadiana 12-yard line when he stepped in front of a Kenneth Batiste pass and returned it to the Acadiana 40. Dugas later ended another drive with an interception at the Acadiana 27. Northside coach Vincent DeRouen said his team didn't play like a top-ranked club. "We didn't step up to the challenge, and we certainly didn't look like a No. 1, and we certainly didn't play like it," DeRouen said. DeRouen said turnovers, mistakes and penalties -- which amounted to 80 yards -- were the main downfall for his team. He also said that Anderson's kickoff return was difficult to overcome. "That hurt us as bad as anything else in the game," DeRouen he said. Printer Friendly Version Send this story to a friend Advertisement Copyright © 2005 2theAdvocate.com, The Advocate, WBRZ.

Willis' Eagles were supposed to host a Tangiphoa Parish team, Loranger, on Thursday night. Now 48 hours after that original game time St. John will travel to Opelousas to take on Westminster Christian at 7 p.m. at Gardner Stadium. St. John is the only Louisiana High School Athletic Association team in the Baton Rouge area scheduled to play in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. That fact doesn't bother Willis. "If people ask why play, I say why not," Willis said. "Our kids have crammed two weeks of work in to get ready. We've done more than football. And we've done our part ? our kids have been at the shelter working every night. Advertisement "We were fortunate that Christian Life canceled their game with Westminster. We were looking for someone to play and so were they. "We're ready to play football. This is something I think will be good for the fans, the players and the coaches." St. John is coming off a 24-7 victory over the Redemptorist junior varsity at last weekend's Jambalaya Jamboree at East Ascension. Chase Blanchard ran for a game-high 88 yards and two touchdowns to lead the Eagles. Rodarrick Jones added 54 yards and one TD. Jones also had an interception. Westminster opened its season with jamboree wins over St. Edmund and Delcambre. Willis said stopping Westminster's option offense will be a challenge, consider the fact that his defense practiced for it for just two days. "I've seen them on film and I'm impressed," Willis said. "We definitely have to be able to stop the option. That won't be easy considering that we only practiced against it two days. We're excited about playing and so are we. I think the game will be a relief for everybody." Printer Friendly Version Send this story to a friend Advertisement Copyright © 2005 2theAdvocate.com, The Advocate, WBRZ. All Rights Reserved.

204	Server: Netscape-Enterprise/2.01 Date: Sun, 04 Sep 2005 00:12:21 GMT Content-type: text/html Home Page Main Sports Football 2K5 Saints Index Flashbacks Training Camp: Depth Chart Roster Schedule Map NFL Draft: Saints' Picks La. Draftees NFC | AFC Preseason Regular Season National TV Weekly NFL NFC | AFC 2004 Season 2004 Results Mickles: Unkindest cuts coming for Saints in San Antonio By SHELDON MICKLES smickles@theadvocate.com Advocate sportswriter In light of what's happened in the past week, it's kind of cruel to think that the New Orleans Saints will have to release 19 players from its roster today. Talk about the unkindest cut of all. In addition to toiling and sweating in the oppressive heat since July 29, those 19 players were cruelly chased away -- like hundreds of thousands of New Orleanians -- from the city before the onslaught of Hurricane Katrina. But business is business, so Saints coach Jim Haslett -- like 31 other NFL coaches -- will have to perform the toughest part of their jobs today: telling 19 men, some of whom may have lost their homes, cars and other possessions on Monday -- that they're no long employed. The Saints' cuts may be complicated by the fact that injuries have kept starting strongside linebacker James Allen, tight end Shad Meier and wide receiver Az-Zahir Hakim from playing the entire preseason. Even though things are up in the air because of the injuries, for a little diversion from hurricane news, let's take a peek at what the 53-man roster might look like: Advertisement QUARTERBACKS (3): Aaron Brooks, Todd Bouman, Adrian McPherson. Cut: None. Last season, the Saints kept only two on the active roster after J.T. O'Sullivan was traded to Green Bay. McPherson might be a practice squad candidate, but there's little chance they'll be able to cut him without being claimed by another team. WIDE RECEIVERS (5): Joe Horn, Donte Stallworth, Devery Henderson, Talman Gardner, Michael Lewis. Cut: Az-Zahir Hakim, Nate Poole, Keron Henry, Chris Vance. It's a tough call, but Hakim hasn't shown enough because of his hamstring problem and Poole is a numbers victim even though he played well against Oakland. TIGHT ENDS (4): Ernie Conwell, Zach Hilton, Lamont Hall, Shad Meier. Cut: Mike Banks. Meier had knee surgery on Aug. 2 and has been out since. He may be too valuable to put on injured reserve, which would sideline him for the season. RUNNING BACKS (5): Deuce McAllister, Mike Karney, Aaron Stecker, Antowain Smith, Fred McAfee. Cut: Nate Schurman, Keith Joseph. This one is pretty cut and dried. OFFENSIVE LINE (8): Wayne Gandy, Kendyl Jacox, LeCharles Bentley, Jermane Mayberry, Jammal Brown, Jamar Nesbit, Montrae Holland, Ben Archibald. Cut: Chad Setterstrom, Ikechuku Ndukwe, Dwayne Ledford, Augie Hoffmann. Because Nesbit, a guard, has played some center and tackle, the Saints can afford to go light here with only three backups. DEFENSIVE LINE (8): Charles Grant, Brian Young, Johnathan Sullivan, Darren Howard, Will Smith, Tony Bryant, Willie Whitehead, Howard Green. Cut: Rodney Leisle, Jimmy Verdon, Anders Akerstrom. The Saints might like to keep nine, but can only afford to keep eight. So the final roster spot may come down to Green or Leisle. LINEBACKERS (7): Sedrick Hodge, Courtney Watson, Colby Bockwoldt, James Allen, T.J. Slaughter, Ronald McKinnon, Terrence Melton. Injured reserve: Alfred Fincher. Cut: Levar Fisher, Cabel Rohloff. Injuries have left this position a big question mark. DEFENSIVE BACKS (10): Mike McKenzie, Fakhir Brown, Jay Bellamy, Dwight Smith, Fred Thomas, Jason Craft, Jimmy Williams, Josh Bullocks, Steve Gleason, Mel Mitchell. Cut: Fred Booker, Matthew Clark. Like running backs, this one should be easy. SPECIALISTS (3): John Carney, Mitch Berger, Kevin Houser. Cut: None. There's no questions here at all.

The two veteran University of Louisiana at Lafayette blockers will at least initially nurture inexperience on the left side of the line where sophomore Will Chance and junior Tim Falter -- both squadmen last year -- block against a?University of Texas defense Hodges describes as tough and physical. "We're going to have to keep those guys relaxed, because against the No. 2 team in the nation, this game is as big as it gets," said Cox, a junior right tackle. "I imagine before the?first play, their eyes will be as big as flying saucers. After that I think those guys (Chance and Falter) are going to be all right." The 6 p.m. kickoff in Austin for the Fox Sports Network nationally televised game features a UL-Lafayette team without a winning record in 10 seasons meeting the Longhorns. Hodges and Cox are both Texas natives from the Dallas area, who grew up admiring the Longhorns' winning tradition. Advertisement Falter's opportunity to start came two weeks ago when projected left tackle starter Jesse Newman injured a knee in the second preseason scrimmage. Chance, a sophomore,?was scheduled to start the season at left tackle, but appeared in only two games last season. What little depth the Cajuns had on the offensive line became thinner when sophomore Zach Leger, a graduate of Bishop Sullivan, was also injured. Cox said Newman could see the playing field during the game, but expects he will have to provide leadership for Falter who starts at guard and Chance. This year Cox, who?has started as a freshman, moves back to right tackle, a position he considers more natural. Hodges, who has played at ULL since 2001, returns at center. The right guard is senior Justin Ernst. Hodges said the Cajuns are eager to play Texas, the highest-ranked opponent in school history. "It's a great challenge to play a team like Texas, which has had great success for as long as I can remember," he said. "It's also an opportunity for us. We can't wait. This game is something we have been working toward all summer and?as far back as the spring wheour schedule was first announced." The young linemen like Chance and Falter don't have much experience, but Hodges said the pair will be ready. "I believe those two guys are going to be OK and they are going to step up if they have to," Hodges said. "Up front it's going to be up to the whole offensive line to come out and be physical. "Offensively we are going to have to dictate the tempo early and how well the linemen carry out their assignments will determine how the game goes," he said. "We have to take care of the football and take care of our players who are going to touch the?ball." The sprinkling of youth along ULL's line is reflected in other areas of the offense. The Cajuns have a pair of sophomore wide receivers with little collegiate experience, while projected tight end starter Erik Jones is a redshirt freshman. The Cajuns have experience at running back, with senior Chester Johnson and fullback Dwight Lindon, a starter at tailback last year. Hodges said the young offense will have to move the ball against a seven-man Texas defensive front which has its share of all-Big 12 returnees and a couple of possible All-America candidates. The defensive line?returns all four starters that some have rated as the best in college football. Tackle Rodrigue Wright was a second-team All-American last year and tackle Larry Dibbles was a first-team all-Big 12 pick. Cox said as far as the linemen are concerned, Falter and Chance will realize the?seriousness of their assignments once the game gets under way. "The is going to be a fun game for (ULL)," Cox said. "They will have almost 90,000 in the stands and I think the young guys along the side of us are going to realize how much fun it is after they go out and make that first hit. When you think about it, this game is aexperience for them like no other." Texas is 38-3 at Memorial Stadium under veteran coach Mac Brown. The Longhorns have won 29 of the last 30 at their stadium. Junior quarterback Vince Young, a Heisman Trophy candidate, has 3,004 career rushing yards and another 5,081 passing. Notes Brown was LSU's quarterback coach in 1982 and served as Tulane's head coach from 1985-87. Another Louisiana connection for the Longhorns is offensive coordinator Greg Davis, who was Tulane's head coach from 1988-91. Texas defensive tackles coach and special teams coordinator Mike Tolleson, an assistant at Louisiana Tech at 1979, also served as the defensive line coach at LSU from 1995-97.

Nicholls State has similar plans, but won't have much time to prepare for the challenge of facing a Big Ten Conference foe. And Hurricane Katrina continues to have a ripple effect on the Sun Belt Conference. SLU Athletic Director Frank Pergolizzi said Friday that the Lions will return to campus Sunday and the plan is to take on Alcorn State. The game will shift from Thursday to Sept. 10, though, because ESPNU has dropped plans to televise the game. The network's crew was scheduled to come from the New Orleans area. "We want to play the game on our campus as long as we can staff it appropriately and as long as it's the right thing to do for our university and our community," Pergolizzi said. Advertisement Pergolizzi said the Southeastern campus is back up and operational with electricity and working phones, but he said much of Hammond is still in the dark. "If the town isn't ready for us to play at home, the folks at Alcorn have indicated to us that they still want to play the game and are willing to move it to their campus if we need to," Pergolizzi said. Nicholls' biggest worry may be the logistics of reconvening a team and rescheduling travel plans. The Colonels' scheduled season opener at Utah State was scrapped because of the storm, and spokesperson Michelle Fakier said that the team is still scattered around the state and likely won't be back on campus together until Tuesday. That would give the Colonels three days of work before they leave for a road trip to face Division I-A opponent Indiana in Bloomington, Ind. Nicholls State officials will also have to rework its travel plans. The original itinerary called for the Colonels to leave from Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport in Kenner, which is now operating only for military and humanitarian aid flights. The Sun Belt took a jolt during the hurricane, but started to get back on its feet Friday. Conference Commissioner Wright Waters said Friday that the league's offices would move to Lafayette and be up and running by Wednesday. "We have services to provide to the media, to the membership and to an awful lot of student athletes," Waters said. The University of New Orleans also suffered major damage during the storm, and that university's offices -- including the sports media relations staff -- has relocated to Baton Rouge. The only bowl game the Sun Belt is tied in with will also be moved. The New Orleans Bowl is scheduled for Dec. 20 at the Superdome, which absorbed major damage during the hurricane. Memphis and Lafayette have expressed interest in hosting the game, Waters said. "I'm 100 percent sure the game will played," he said. "But I'm zero percent sure on where the game will be played." The Associated Press contributed to this report.

208	 Main Index Colleges Preps Pros Mr. Saturday Night Life in football prepares LSU's Miles for greatest challenge By SCOTT RABALAIS srabalais@theadvocate.com Advocate sportswriter Advocate staff photo by Liz Condo Les Miles If Les Miles hadn't become a football coach then today he might be ... ... a lawyer ... the owner of his own trucking firm ... the next Johnny Carson. "He'd always be entertaining," recalled one of Miles' oldest friends, Jack Sito. "We played baseball together in high school. If the bus was full, he'd start dancing. Then he'd put his hands on the back of two seats and balanced one foot on the ceiling of the bus, just to get things going. "Someone called it the triple tripod." It was on one of those trips, after he executed his dismount, that young Les confided his dream to Jack. "He told me, 'Jack, I want to be an entertainer. I want to be a Johnny Carson. I don't know how I'm going to do it, but I like Johnny Carson.' " Jack knew his friend Les too well to doubt him completely. "If he put his mind to something, he was going to do it," Sito said. "You could see that on the football field." Of course, Les Miles never became the new King of Late Night. Just a few short months ago he accepted an offer to become the King of Louisiana Saturday Night, taking on the monumental yet irresistible challenge to become the 32nd football coach at LSU. He was in some ways a surprising choice to replace Nick Saban, the coach who left for the Miami Dolphins after five seasons in Tigertown that included a BCS national championship and two Southeastern Conference titles. LSU/SEC/NATIONAL Miles takes on LSU challenge Tigers won't sneak up on anyone LSU's Niswanger studious, curious LSU's Williams makes presence felt Arizona State, Appalachian State to visit Rose marks end, or beginning, of era SEC West: LSU appears to top list | Capsules SEC East: Leak makes difference | Capsules Columns: Scott Rabalais | Sam King There have been plenty of people who wonder if he's the man to continue Saban's legacy of success. Those people don't include Les Miles. "There's a very special past that surrounds LSU football," Miles said recently. "I don't have to convince anybody. We understand that if we do the things that we're capable of doing that we have a chance to have a special season. That's an advantage to LSU." An advantage to Les Miles is that he always believed in himself. Believed that an undersized kid from northern Ohio could play offensive guard for the powerhouse Michigan teams of the 1970s. Believed that he could be a coach, someday at the highest level, and perhaps carve out some of the same kind of legacy that his mentor at Michigan did for himself. Duke Leslie Edwin Miles was born on Nov. 10, 1953, to Hope and Martha Miles. Each had a daughter from previous marriages, but Les was their first child together. Three more children followed -- Mark, AnnHope and Eric. They grew up in Elyria, Ohio, a city of about 55,000 some 24 miles southwest of Cleveland. It is, not surprisingly, a Cleveland Browns town. It's an Ohio State Buckeyes town. And, when Les Miles was growing up, a town in love with its Elyria High School Pioneers. The school dates to 1830, the first chartered high school west of the Allegheny Mountains according to a sign in front of the main building, its stone facade dug from a nearby quarry. Today, the town has a rusted quaintness to it but holds onto some of the same characteristics it had when Miles was a boy: block after block of wood-framed houses with American flags anchored to front porches, a few churches, a fountain in the courthouse square. "It was a place where there was a lot of opportunity for a young guy growing up," Miles said. "I swam in the Junior Olympic program for a summer. I played baseball in every youth league. There were a lot of people in the community willing to give to the kids. "It was middle income, lower income. There was high income, some really nice homes, but I really didn't see it." Elyria High School had a storied football program. Vic Janowicz, the 1950 Heisman Trophy winner at Ohio State, was a Pioneer. His name and No. 22 are immortalized on the front of the Ely Stadium press box on the south side of town. Elyria High sits at 311 Vic Janowicz Dr. Once, Janowicz came back for a hall of fame function. A young Les Miles was excited to shake his hand. It was Hope Miles, though, who was the most important man in Les' life. Hope was a big man in Elyria, in every sense of the word. Once he held down three jobs as a policeman, a worker for Ford and as a truck insurance agent to provide for his family. Eventually, though, he became vice president for a steel company, Ferris Metal. Hope Miles was a Paul Bunyanesque figure, 6-foot-5, weighing more than 300 pounds, gruff and tough, once an all-state football player in his native Virginia and a legendary softball player in northern Ohio. "A lot of people were afraid of Les' dad," said John Sheldon, Les' high school line coach. "I remember as a little kid following him around," Les Miles said. "He had a reputation for knocking the snot out of the ball. He was an all-world catcher." As Les grew, Hope channeled his sports ambitions into coaching his son on the youth league level. "He coached me in every sport I ever played -- whether I needed it or not," Miles said. Sports gave Hope and Les a special father-and-son bond. Hope Miles loved John Wayne movies -- a love of movies his oldest son inherited. Eventually, he started calling his oldest son by Wayne's nickname, "Duke." "I don't think anyone on our teams called him Duke at all," said Steve Sunagel, who played baseball and football with Les. "That was between him and his father." Of course, most anyone who saw Les play a sporting event soon learned what his nickname was. "When Les wrestled in the city championship," Martha Miles recalled, "(Hope) said to me, 'Remember, all his teachers are here and we've got to be quiet.' "Well, we sit at the top of the bleachers and Les gets the first takedown and Hope goes bananas. 'That's it, Doook!' And he's rocking the bleachers." Les often heard his dad from the stands, especially in football. "I was in eighth grade playing on the ninth-grade team and I was going down on kickoffs," Miles said. "He didn't care who I was supposed to block. He'd say, 'No. 44, Duke' in kind of a loud voice. If I didn't go and knock that guy over, something was wrong." Hope Miles' voice was loud and clear for Les, it wasn't for his little brother Mark, who was deaf. "My brother was a year younger than I am and he was never in the home with me hardly at all," Les said. "My mom had to take him to every school there possibly was to get him some education. He ended up first in Columbus, Ohio, for grade school, then went to a high school for the deaf and Galludet (University) in Washington." Les learned sign language to try to communicate with Mark. He once used his skills to help recruit a deaf player to Oklahoma State. "I'm a terrible sign guy," Miles said. "He taught me to sign out of necessity. But I was slow." Les was quick at football, though not always entirely successful. During Miles' sophomore year at Elyria, his sophomore team was going to play against rival Sandusky. To try to inspire his son on the way to the game, Hope Miles offered an incentive. "You do good and we'll get you a nice winter jacket," the father said. "I'm like, 'Hey, that sounds like fun, dad,'" Les recalled. The incentive plan didn't work. After two holding penalties, he was back on the sideline when Hope came Les' way. "He walks by the bench and says in kind of a low whisper, 'It's going to be a cold winter, Duke,' " Miles said laughing, warmed by the memory from long ago. Pioneer spirit Les really didn't need much encouragement according to Sheldon, who instructed Miles as he became an all-state offensive guard and defensive tackle. "We'd get the scouting report on Monday and I would say, 'Wow, Les, look who you've got this week,'" Sheldon said. "'A 260 (pound) guy. He's quick.' "Les would say, 'Don't worry, coach.' "Each day he got more and more intense. You didn't want to talk to him too much on Thursday." Miles might have wanted to be Johnny Carson off the field, but he displayed a Dick Butkus-like intensity on it. Once in practice he drilled one of Elyria's running backs with a vicious hit, telling his coaches he didn't think his teammate was running hard enough. Against another Elyria rival, Fremont, Sunagel was playing defensive back when he took a cheap shot from a receiver to the jaw. A referee saw the punch and threw a flag on Fremont. Miles saw the flag and thought Sunagel was to blame. "Here comes Les Miles. This is how intense he was," Sunagel said. "He starts shaking me and saying, 'What are you doing? What are you doing?' "I said, 'Les, it's on them.' 'Oh? Great job! Great job!' Then we run back to the huddle." After a game, Miles and Sunagel might laugh over such things. It was as though Les were two different people -- the ball-playing Les and the fun-loving Les. "He could turn it on and off," said Sunagel, now a businessman who also coaches Elyria High's baseball team. "Away from the field he had a good time. Get to the field it's take charge. Nothing else is on your mind but that game." Elyria rarely lost in football. In 1968, the year before Miles started going to Elyria as a sophomore, the Pioneers went 10-0. During Les' three years at Elyria, the Pioneers went 10-0, 9-1 and 10-0. Because there was no playoff system in Ohio prep football in 1971, the Pioneers had to settle for being ranked No. 2 in the state's top classification, Class I, behind Warren Western Reserve. A playoff wouldn't come until 1975. For all its success back then, Elyria has never had another Janowicz, nor another Miles, and has never made it to the playoffs. When he wasn't playing football, Miles fashioned an outstanding wrestling career. Battling in the heavyweight division though he carried only about 210 pounds on his 6-foot-1 frame -- and often had to stuff himself with food before matches to make weight -- Miles' only loss his senior year was in the state tournament to Tim Totten, a 275-pounder and eventual state champion. More than 30 years later, the loss still rankles him. "My greatest athletic regret," Miles said. "I always felt like I could win." A Michigan man In a small town that loved its high school football team, Miles became well known. Eventually, though, it was for more than his athletic exploits. An incident one night at a dance helped build a reputation that though not as big as his dad, you didn't mess with Les. "Les in general is a protector," Sito said. "He doesn't like people talking bad about anyone. His idea is to have fun, but not to denigrate anyone. "I remember at this dance, Les walked outside and there was this guy who'd been drinking. He was jealous, I think, because Les was a big-time athlete. When he went to hit Les he swung and missed and his face hit the ground. "They took him away in an ambulance. Les never touched him, but people thought he had just kicked his butt." Miles didn't seek out fights, but he did stand up for himself and others, whether it was a neighborhood bully or a group of guys at another dance who were harassing coach Sheldon's daughter. Les did floor one of those guys -- landing his one punch. "Les made sure no one messed with anyone else," Sito said. "He took care of his friends." He didn't mind standing out in a crowd, or bucking a trend. In an era when counterculture was in, Les was "counter-cultured." His dad, a former Navy man, cropped his hair short. So did Les, shorter typically than the prevalent style, not caring if he seemed "square" to those around him (Les finally let his hair grow in college). Sometimes, Hope would come and visit Les at school during lunch period, something that would embarrass many teens into an early grave. Les instead would run up to his father and embrace him. Many in Elyria expected Miles to go to Ohio State and play for Woody Hayes, the Buckeyes' highly successful, highly volatile coach. Hayes came to speak at an Elyria High banquet, seemingly paving the way for Miles to go there. Soon, however, Les' coaches and family figured out he wouldn't be a Buckeye. Though he would never say so, Martha Miles thought her son was turned off by Hayes' sideline ranting and raving. He did say how impressed he was when first-year Michigan coach Bo Schembechler, Hayes' former player at Miami of Ohio and a one-time assistant at Ohio State, beat his old boss 24-12 in Ann Arbor in 1969. "It was more than Woody Hayes could take," Martha said. "His team had to about pull him off (the field). "Les never said a word. He never opened his mouth about it. But that was the end. He didn't want to go there." Les made a recruiting visit to Ohio State, but was not swayed. "He was very dogmatic," Sheldon said. "He wasn't interested in Ohio State." Miles was instead pulled into Schembechler's orbit. After visits to Wisconsin and Indiana, Miles signed with the Wolverines. "He was an undersized offensive guard," Schembechler said. "The best way to describe him is he had all the necessary skills, the quickness. He could run. He could come off the line of scrimmage. He was just a little small. "But I would describe him as a feisty player. He would do anything to get you blocked." Confident his Vietnam draft number wouldn't be called -- Miles' received 241 and only numbers up to about 60 were being taken at the time -- he went to Ann Arbor in the fall of 1972. Freshmen were ineligible to play then, so Miles watched from the sideline as Michigan went 10-1, losing only to Ohio State. He was eligible to play but didn't letter in 1973 as the Wolverines went 10-0-1 with only a 10-10 tie with Ohio State to mar the record. Finally, No. 63 saw the field in 1974. Michigan again won its first 10 games but was stymied by its archrival Buckeyes, 12-10. Though they shared the Big Ten title with the Buckeyes, Michigan was denied the Rose Bowl or any bowl. Big Ten rules at the time allowed its teams to only go to the Rose Bowl. Schembechler and others lobbied to have the rule changed. In 1975, Miles' senior season, the Wolverines went 8-2-2 and finished in the Orange Bowl with a 14-6 loss to Oklahoma. A defining moment When Michigan returned from Miami, it seemed football was a closed chapter for Les Miles. Even bulked up as much as he could at 6-1, 230, while still maintaining his quickness, there was less chance Les would be taken in the NFL draft than in the Vietnam draft. He graduated in 1976 with a degree in economics and seemed intent on leaving football behind. "I felt like I was going to go out and have a career in business," Miles said. He moved back to Ohio and became a trucking agent. His main job was taking steel from Lorain Steel near Elyria and getting it distributed through two trucking companies, Helms Express and Superior Trucking. The job paid well for the time. Miles made $32,000 a year, had a company car, an expense account to pay for his gas. At the end of the year he received a $13,000 bonus. Despite his success, Miles found himself at a crossroads. He could look down one road and see himself one day maybe having his own trucking business, or becoming a high-ranking company man like his father. But something about the work left him unfulfilled. He longed to return down the road to Ann Arbor, to football. "I thought about all the things I had done in my life, which to that point weren't many," Miles said. "How much I really appreciated the sincerity of the goal, of having championship focus. How hard it really was, because it was a whole lot easier (to keep) doing what I was doing." When he played football, Miles said he never considered becoming a coach. But he already had a coach's qualities in him. When Les would watch his brother Eric wrestle he would give him instruction from the stands -- like his dad did with him. Les was in the trucking business not quite a year when he decided he wanted to return to football. If it didn't work out, he thought maybe he would go to law school, but for now this was his burning desire. "I so respected the endeavor (of coaching) that when I got out I didn't think anything I was doing was near as rewarding as what I had done," Miles said. "So I decided to ask coach Schembechler to take me back." Sunagel said Miles phoned Schembechler 33 times before he finally took his call. Miles doesn't remember it that way, but admitted he lobbied his former coach long and hard. "If he gave me a minute, I was in his office," Miles said. "Initially he would tell me, 'Ah, Miles, you sure you want to do this?' To get him convinced, it probably took me six months." Schembechler had seen football-starved former players come back before. "When they come out and go into business or some other thing and decide they want to coach, sometimes it's too late," Schembechler said. "When you start in coaching, you start at the bottom. You've got to find out if you really want to do it or not. The best way is to do it as a GA (graduate assistant), make the coffee, pick up prospects at the airport. I did that for Woody Hayes and Les did that for me." Persuaded at last, Schembechler told Miles to report to Michigan in July 1977. His salary would be $8,200 a year. Miles spent three seasons as a graduate assistant before Schembechler made him a part-time assistant in 1980. It was still something of a hand-to-mouth existence. But it was coaching football, and that was everything. "All we had was football and ourselves," said John Wangler, a Michigan quarterback who became a GA and Miles' roommate after he finished playing in 1980. "Les and I lived on campus. We got a break because we were landlords of this apartment building. "But it didn't matter about the money or whether we worked 70, 80 hours a week. It was about coaching." New beginnings After the 1981 season, Michigan defensive coordinator Bill McCartney left Ann Arbor to become head coach at Colorado. He asked Miles to come with him as a graduate assistant. "Offensive linemen are the guys on the team who are the most selfless," McCartney said. "Those are the types of guys who make great coaches. Miles came out of that environment -- extremely well coached, well disciplined. When you're coaching, you look for that kind of guy." Miles became a full-time offensive line coach in 1983 and stayed with McCartney through the 1986 season as they built Colorado toward becoming the program that shared the 1990 national championship. During that time, Miles was on the staff with another future LSU coach, Gerry DiNardo, who became Colorado's offensive coordinator in 1984. After the 1986 season, Miles returned to Michigan as offensive line coach. Though it may have looked like a lateral career move, by early 1987 it proved to be better than that. "Our head coach decided we were going to do more territorial recruiting like football did," said Kathy Miles, Les' wife and then a first-year assistant on the Michigan women's basketball team. "He called me in his office and said 'You're going to do the Detroit/Flint area and Chicago. I'm going to give you a name of our assistant football coach who recruits Chicago, and he can give you names of alums in the area and high schools that have been supportive of Michigan. "So he wrote on a little yellow piece of paper, 'Les Miles.'" As she headed back to her office, Kathy stopped and asked her boss, Bud VanDeWege, what Miles was like. "Typical football coach," he replied. Maybe for that reason, Kathy didn't go see Les right away. One day that spring, Miles and Wangler were returning from a Detroit Pistons-Boston Celtics playoff game. Miles was getting out of his car when he crossed paths with Kathy LaBarge in the athletic department parking lot. For a while they just talked basketball. Eventually though, he said, "By the way, I'm Les Miles." "I said, 'I'm supposed to meet you to talk about recruiting in Chicago,'" Kathy Miles said. "I remember after he left walking up the steps and grabbing the door and my boss was coming behind me. I must have had a big smile because in my mind I wanted to say, 'You didn't tell me he was that good looking.' Of course, you have a male boss and you're not going to say that because you want to be professional." Les was smitten, too. "I don't know if you believe in love at first sight," he said. "I was single, having fun, dating. But I thought that, right there, was just what I was looking for." At first their relationship was on the sports level. Les had run a marathon before and he and Kathy started running together. "Les and I used to run every day together at lunch," said Cam Cameron, then a Michigan assistant and now offensive coordinator of the San Diego Chargers. "One day we weren't running together any more. He was running with Kathy." Still, Les and Kathy didn't have a serious date for a year and half. And even then, the first "date" didn't work out. Both thought the other had stood them up. Cameron mediated the dispute. "He came by and said, 'Yeah, I heard you stood Les up,' " Kathy recalled. "I said, 'I didn't stand him up, he stood me up. I was there, I was just late.' So that kind of helped bridge the gap." Kathy and Les dated for four years and finally got married June 5, 1993. They quickly started a family. Les wanted four kids, Kathy two or three. Kathy won when it came to running, Les when it came to family planning. Today they have four children. Kathryn, nicknamed Smacker for the way she smacked her lips as a baby, is 11. Leslie Matthew, nicknamed Manny, is 9. Benjamin turns 7 the week of the North Texas game. And Macy Grace, who can already sing the words to "Hey Fighting Tigers," is 2. 'Serious inconvenience' Soon after Kathryn was born, Les left Michigan again, this time for good. He was offered a job as offensive coordinator at Oklahoma State, where he spent the 1995-97 seasons. Just before the 1998 season, Miles was on the move again, becoming tight ends coach for the Dallas Cowboys. Miles spent three seasons there, working for head coaches Chan Gailey and Dave Campo. "He always liked LSU," Kathy Miles said. "He always thought about LSU from when he was with David LaFleur with the Dallas Cowboys. That's when he became more familiar with LSU and thought in the back of his mind that if he had the opportunity that was one of the schools he might want to go to." LSU hired Saban away from Michigan State to replace DiNardo before the 2000 season. A year later, Miles went back to Oklahoma State to become head coach. It was a thrilling opportunity, but one tempered by the death of his father, Hope, who died on Sept. 13, 2000 at 73. Hope Miles underwent open heart surgery not long before and appeared to be recovering. But one day when someone pulled into his driveway to ask directions, Hope turned and fell, breaking his hip. "That was really the end," Martha Miles said. "He just never got over that, really." Oklahoma State won only three of its first 10 games in 2001 and fans in Stillwater were starting to become restless. That was until Nov. 24, when the Cowboys went to Norman, Okla., and upset the No. 4-ranked Sooners, 16-13. The rivalry between the schools is known as the Bedlam Series. Bedlam indeed. After the win, someone from Oklahoma griped: "Some people are happy with four wins." "We are not happy with four wins," Miles shot back. "It will not be until we are a bowl team, until we win a national championship that we will be happy. "But," he said with a sly grin, "we enjoyed that victory more than they enjoyed any of theirs." The high over beating Oklahoma was short-lived. One morning in December 2001, Les went for a run and returned feeling sick and nauseated with an intense headache. The headache didn't subside. A doctor in Stillwater referred him to a specialist in Oklahoma City. The diagnosis: a cyst on his brain was causing a buildup of fluid. Surgery was required to relieve what doctors termed the "intra-cranial pressure." Les described his medical problems to reporters at the time as a "serious inconvenience." To Kathy, it was more than that. "When they took him up to Oklahoma City and did an MRI up there, it was a very tense moment for me because you don't know what they're going to come out and say," she recalled. "That was probably the most intense moment of our married life." Through Schembechler, Les found a doctor he wanted in Cleveland to perform the surgery. While their three young children went to stay with Les' mother and sister at their home in Lodi, Ohio, just south of Elyria, Kathy went with Les for his surgery on Christmas Eve. "Instead of taking the cyst out they just clipped it," Martha Miles said. "That relieved the pressure and it's never grown back. If they had gone in and dug out that cyst, there would have been damage all around and it would have really been a disaster." Kathy thought Les would be in the hospital for several days. After returning from Lodi to help the children open their Christmas presents, she found Les pulling on his old Dallas Cowboys sweats. "Get your stuff," he told her. "We're going." "Are you kidding?" Kathy asked him. "They're letting you go?" By the first week of January, Miles was back in Stillwater and on the recruiting trail. The headaches have never returned. Remember the Alamo With his health restored, Miles set about restoring an Oklahoma State program that had suffered through four straight losing seasons before he arrived. The turnaround began in 2002. The Cowboys upset No. 3 Oklahoma again and finished 8-5. A 9-4 season followed in 2003. In 2004 the Cowboys were 6-1 going into the annual grudge match with Oklahoma. The Sooners prevailed 38-35; Oklahoma State kicker Jason Ricks missed a potential game-tying 49-yard field goal with 11 seconds left. After the game was over, Miles found his kicker and hugged him. "I was so proud when I saw that," Martha Miles said. "I thought, 'That's how it should be.' That kid the rest of his life will kick himself because he didn't make it." It wasn't the first time Miles acted as the compassionate leader of his program. When he signed his first contract at Oklahoma State he settled for $400,000 per year with the provision the school add a similar amount to the pool for his coaches' salaries. Miles made sure his assistants got long-term contracts, a policy continued at LSU. Only one more win followed in 2004 before 7-4 Oklahoma State went to San Antonio for an Alamo Bowl game with Ohio State. It wasn't a typical bowl week for Miles or the Cowboys. A couple of weeks earlier he had received a call from someone representing LSU gauging his interest should Saban leave. By the time Saban announced he was going to the Miami Dolphins in a Christmas Day news conference, Miles' name swirled as a potential candidate. Before the Dec. 29 Alamo Bowl, LSU Athletic Director Skip Bertman flew to San Antonio to interview Miles, whose name emerged as a co-favorite for the LSU job with Louisville's Bobby Petrino. Miles, who had just signed an extension through 2011 that was to pay him an average of $1.5 million plus an annuity, denied interest. Privately, it was another matter. "I've got to be honest," Miles said. "I was distracted. I did nothing differently. I worked harder to prepare. I realized that it was a distraction for my team, especially by game day. It was everywhere that I was in contention for the job." Ohio State rolled to win 33-7. Earlier in the week, Kathy Miles had reassured some anxious Oklahoma State administrators that they weren't going anywhere. After such a lopsided defeat, she was even more sure of that now. "In the world of football, you're usually about as good as you're last game," Kathy said. "When you take a beating like we did from Ohio State, we were both thinking, 'Nah, LSU probably won't call again.' "For me, when they did call back, it was the first time I got serious in my mind that we might be going." New Year's Eve in Stillwater was a roller-coaster ride for the Miles family. "We talked and talked," Kathy said. "He'd talk on the phone to LSU and he'd talk on the phone to Oklahoma State. "But there was really one time when we called all the kids in the bedroom and said, 'This is what I think we're going to do.' That's when the decision was really made." New Year's Day, while LSU was losing to Iowa 30-25 in the Capital One Bowl, all six members of the Miles family went house-to-house to tell the assistants of their decision in a series of often tearful face-to-face encounters. Mike Gundy, a former Oklahoma State quarterback and Miles' offensive coordinator, was quickly named his successor. He tried to keep as many assistants as he could. But five decided to follow Miles to LSU. Emerging from shadows The comparisons will continue to be made between Saban and Miles given the former LSU coach's Type-A personality and Miles' affable exterior. Kathy Miles said LSU fans wanting a hard-driven coach shouldn't worry. They still have one. "Intensity is definitely a word that I would define him with," she said. "But at the same time he can detach. It's always amazed me how he can come home and sleep after a game. He's a type who's real good at controlling what he can control and not worrying about the rest of it. "He can come home and forget it all and play with the kids. But when it's time to come back to it, he's as intense as anybody and doesn't leave a stone unturned." Cameron recalled what a competitor Miles could be from their days at Michigan. "It was the spring game in Ann Arbor and I'm on one side and he's on the other," Cameron said. "They're driving to score and he's the head coach of that team. An official made a bad call -- and it was -- that cost them the game. You'd think the world had come to an end. I've never seen a guy so upset about a spring game. I gave him a hard time about it for years." The high expectations attached to Miles' first year are higher than the altitude in Colorado. But McCartney believes he can handle it. "That's good," he said. "When he was at Michigan, expectations were always high." Some LSU fans may wonder whether Miles is the right guy for the job. They aren't the people who know him best. "He's got destiny on his side," Sunagel said. "He's just that kind of guy. I think LSU made the right choice." "He has a fire inside him that probably won't be shown publicly. Don't let that laissez-faire kind of appearance fool you. He'll beat you on the field."

209	 Main Index Colleges Preps Pros Tigers won't sneak up on anyone this season By CARL DUBOIS cdubois@theadvocate.com Advocate sportswriter Advocate staff photo by Travis Spradling Joseph Addai is LSU's top returning running back. There it is, on LSU's highlight video from 2003, the BCS national championship season. Nick Saban, before the first game of his fourth year as coach of the Tigers, told his players they had a chance to do something special in the months ahead of them. They did, losing but once and surprising many by bringing the crystal ball trophy back to Baton Rouge after winning the Nokia Sugar Bowl. Whatever success LSU has this season, it will not come from under anyone's radar. The Tigers are ranked in the top 10, and Phil Steele, who has displayed an uncanny knack for predictions the last five years, and College Football News are among those who project LSU to play in the Rose Bowl for another BCS national championship. The 2003 team had high expectations, but not like this. As it climbed the rankings, Saban downplayed talk of big games, preaching a stay-in-the-moment philosophy, and the Tigers emerged with a 13-1 record and the program's first national title in 45 years. Now, Saban is in the NFL, trying to return the Miami Dolphins to greatness with the same methods he used at LSU. His successor, Les Miles, inherits a much better program than what Saban found when he arrived at the end of November 1999. Miles and his players acknowledged early in preseason camp they have the chance to do something special this year. Players on both sides of the ball are energized by the plans their coaches are making to help them reach their goals. Jimbo Fisher, the offensive coordinator and coach of the quarterbacks, held those jobs for Saban's full tenure, and retaining Fisher was one of Miles' best recruiting success stories. LSU/SEC/NATIONAL Miles takes on LSU challenge Tigers won't sneak up on anyone LSU's Niswanger studious, curious LSU's Williams makes presence felt Arizona State, Appalachian State to visit Rose marks end, or beginning, of era SEC West: LSU appears to top list | Capsules SEC East: Leak makes difference | Capsules Columns: Scott Rabalais | Sam King LSU senior wide receiver Skyler Green noted this will be quarterback JaMarcus Russell's third season of learning the offense under Fisher's direction, and he said having Fisher back is one of the biggest reasons the offensive players are upbeat about this season. "It means a lot to the receivers," Green said, grinning. "It's going to be an exciting year, because coach Fisher seems like he's putting everything in JaMarcus' hands. It's like, 'You've got to run the ball, and you've got to throw the ball.' "You're going to get some of everything this year. It's not going to be one-dimensional in one game. It's going to be balanced every game." There is, of course, the possibility of a quarterback controversy, but Miles made clear in the offseason he wants one man to win the job and hold onto it. He played mostly one quarterback while at Oklahoma State, and he doesn't want LSU to have an unsettled quarterback situation like it did a year ago. Whether it's Russell, classmate Matt Flynn or incoming freshman Ryan Perrilloux who pulls the trigger, there will be many choices for Fisher and passing game coordinator Todd Monken, whose primary duty is coaching the receivers. "Everybody we put on the field can get the job done," Green said. "We hope to be able to do more things on offense this year because we have a lot more experience," Fisher said. "We have players who have done it before, and they've done it with success in some pretty big games and big situations." Justin Vincent was the Most Valuable Player of the 2003 SEC Championship Game and the BCS championship game. Shyrone Carey scored a critical touchdown in the 17-10 victory over Georgia that made those games possible. Alley Broussard and Joseph Addai helped rescue the running game in the middle of the season, and a year later they became the most prominent workers in the backfield. Broussard is out for the season with a knee injury, but Addai is back for his senior season. The three vets seem more focused than ever after the loss of Broussard. The receivers, young and brimming with raw talent a year ago, are back with more seasoning and, in some cases, a dose of humility. Green, who played hurt throughout the 2004 season, said he feels good and should be more explosive as a receiver and kick returner this season. The line features veterans Andrew Whitworth, Rudy Niswanger and Nate Livings, plus a handful of backups with quality experience as backups or part-time starters. Livings said the talk of a more open offense isn't his motivation, and if he's looking forward to playing on a more explosive offense, he isn't letting it show. "I leave the 'looking forward to' to the fans," Livings said. "I'm just playing a game, and that's our level. Coach is going to give us the plays, and that's what we're going to run. "Whether it be running the ball 100 times a game or passing, we're just out there working. Whatever is called, that's what we're going to run. I'll leave the 'looking forward to' to the fans." New defensive coordinator Bo Pelini takes over for Will Muschamp, who followed Saban to Miami. Saban was the mastermind of the defense, which was noted for having complex blitz packages and disguises that confused and confounded opposing offenses. LSU named blitzes for states and ran out of names. Saban had to start naming blitzes for other things, including animals, some of which might even be extinct. That type of complexity appears to be as well. Pelini said he prefers to teach overall concepts of defense, not tax the players with too much memorization. "We're not going to overload them with checks and 9,000 different things," he said. "We're going to be very sound in what we do, but we're going to make sure they're extremely confident when they walk onto the field, not confused or trying to remember what they memorized." Don't think that means an end to aggressive defensive play at LSU. In 2003, when Pelini was defensive coordinator at Nebraska, the Huskers set a school record with 47 turnovers, including 32 interceptions. They swarmed to the football. The changes Pelini has made at LSU has strong-side linebacker Kenneth Hollis smiling. "I like the defensive style we're playing this year," Hollis said. "The linebackers are going to be more flexible to the pass and covering routes and things like that." Hollis and middle linebacker Cameron Vaughn said they like Pelini's version of the 4-3 defense because it's more of a true 4-3 look, with linebackers behind the linemen instead of up on the line of scrimmage at times. "I won't be on the line, over the tight end a lot, like last year," Hollis said. "This year I'll be more in the backfield as a true three-linebacker look, running sideline to sideline. "There won't be a lot of difference in one respect, because our defense is still going to be the same -- we're still going to bring the pain and run after the ball." And try to take it away. "We're not just there to stop the other team," Pelini said. "We want the ball." Hollis said he likes that attitude, and it has pervaded preseason practices. Pelini teaches the Tigers to make the tackle, wrap up and try to strip the ball. "He told us how every day at practice at Nebraska they focused on taking the ball away from the running backs and receivers," Hollis said. "The offense and defense would actually get into a fight because the defense had more takeaways." Tackles Kyle Williams and Claude Wroten are back, and the depth at defensive end is a positive to offset the loss of Marcus Spears to the NFL. Hollis said he expects Vaughn to be a capable middle linebacker, having played and learned behind Lionel Turner. Cornerbacks Corey Webster and Travis Daniels are in the NFL, but there are backups with experience, and there is healthy competition for playing time. "We're just waiting on the chance to get the right people on the field at the right time," Hollis said, "but I think everybody's good. Coach has decided he's going to give everybody a chance to play." Green said he feels the same way about the offense, and he sounded like he is confident the Tigers will present a lot of problems to the teams on their schedule. "We're just looking forward to playing against whoever's going to except that challenge," Green said. If the Tigers do something special this season, it doesn't seem like they will be surprised.

210	 Main Index Colleges Preps Pros Arizona State, Appalachian State to play at LSU By CARL DUBOIS cdubois@theadvocate.com Advocate sportswriter Two teams with the initials ASU will come into Tiger Stadium this season to play against LSU for the first time. They come from vastly different worlds. Arizona State is on some preseason Top 25 lists, a sleeper in the Pac-10 Conference, which is dominated by reigning national champion Southern California and features the likes of California and Oregon, two other highly regarded teams. Appalachian State is a Division I-AA program attached to LSU's schedule after attempts to find a willing I-A opponent failed. Arizona State plays LSU on Sept. 10, two weeks before the Tigers open Southeastern Conference play against Tennessee. The Sun Devils of Tempe, a suburb of Phoenix, lost only 10 lettermen from last year, the fewest in the Pac-10. They had an up-and-down season, starting 5-0, including a 44-7 victory over Iowa, which defeated LSU in the Capital One Bowl. Southern California and Cal ended Arizona State's hopes of a dream season, and combined to crush the Sun Devils 72-7. LSU/SEC/NATIONAL Miles takes on LSU challenge Tigers won't sneak up on anyone LSU's Niswanger studious, curious LSU's Williams makes presence felt Arizona State, Appalachian State to visit Rose marks end, or beginning, of era SEC West: LSU appears to top list | Capsules SEC East: Leak makes difference | Capsules Columns: Scott Rabalais | Sam King Highlighted by the play of backup quarterback Sam Keller, who becomes the starter this season, Arizona State defeated Purdue 27-23 in the Sun Bowl to finish on a positive note at 9-3. That momentum and confidence is what the Sun Devils hope to carry over into this season. Keller has a premier target in wide receiver Derek Hagan, ranked by ESPN as the No. 10 offensive player in the nation this season. "The Sun Bowl win springboarded us into the offseason," coach Dirk Koetter said. "I think our guys said, 'Hey, Sam Keller is pretty good, and we are going to have a good football team next year.' " Next year is here, but not without setbacks. The loss of tailback Loren Wade for disciplinary reasons hurt, but the Sun Devils have good players stepping into the void. Transfers figure to make an impact on defense, and there is continuity on the coaching staff, which should help. Arizona State catches a break with its schedule: The Devils play USC and Oregon in Tempe, and they don't play Cal this season. Appalachian State, across the country in Boone, N.C., competes in the Southern Conference, annually one of the strongest conferences in Division I-AA. Jerry Moore has been coach of the Mountaineers for 16 seasons, winning 67 percent of his games. Last season Appalachian State was 6-5 and finished 4-3 in the Southern Conference, tied for third place. They return 17 starters, including nine on defense. After missing the playoffs in back-to-back years for the first time in two decades, the Mountaineers are eager to return to a prominent place in I-AA. Much of their success will depend upon the play of quarterback Richie Williams, a senior the school is touting as a candidate for the Walter Payton Award, the I-AA version of the Heisman Trophy. The trip to Tiger Stadium is one of seven road trips for the Mountaineers. The schedule features four home games, none of them back-to-back. Even worse news: Appalachian State didn't win on the road in five tries last season. The Mountaineers will become the fourth I-AA team to play LSU in six seasons. The first two were also from the Southern Conference: Western Carolina (2000) and The Citadel (2002). Western Illinois (2003) is the other I-AA opponent in LSU's history.

211	 Main Index Colleges Preps Pros Rabalais: Intrigue matches potential for LSU By SCOTT RABALAIS srabalais@theadvocate.com Advocate sportswriter I've been covering LSU football since 1992, been following it since 1972 when my parents took me to see the Tigers play on a soggy Saturday night. I don't remember the game really, but I did learn early on that despite what the grown-ups tried to tell me it indeed does rain in Tiger Stadium. The players looked like giants to me then. They still do. That's one thing that hasn't changed. I know my 33-year perspective on LSU football may seem like a mere snapshot to many of you who have been devoted to the Tigers since the days of Billy Cannon and before. But I feel qualified in saying that in my range of personal experience I've seen the Tigers at their very worst -- 2-9 in 1992 -- and at their very best with the 13-1 record and BCS championship. So using my personal experience as a benchmark, I cannot remember going into an LSU football season that was laden with such intrigue. So many questions and so much potential that could end up delivering such great excitement or bitter disappointment. LSU/SEC/NATIONAL Miles takes on LSU challenge Tigers won't sneak up on anyone LSU's Niswanger studious, curious LSU's Williams makes presence felt Arizona State, Appalachian State to visit Rose marks end, or beginning, of era SEC West: LSU appears to top list | Capsules SEC East: Leak makes difference | Capsules Columns: Scott Rabalais | Sam King No, not disappointment along the lines of 2-9, or even a losing record, or even missing a bowl game. But when so much is expected, so much is possible, even the slightest stumble can lead to a very large fall. The reason for the high expectations is in part because LSU won the BCS title two years ago, but more because the Tigers are LOADED. There is talent deep and plentiful at virtually every position. Nine starters return on offense -- it was 10 before tailback Alley Broussard's injury -- seven are back on defense, and even on that side of the ball the talent if not the experience seems plausible to replace. There are some critical vulnerabilities, of course. The Tigers are deep and loaded at quarterback, too. But consistent, proven success isn't there. Though sophomores JaMarcus Russell and Matt Flynn have experience, it isn't enough to inspire widespread consumer confidence. As for freshman phenom Ryan Perrilloux, the idea of handing him the keys to this offense is like LSU coach Les Miles handing him the keys to his Eddie Bauer Expedition courtesy car. Sure, Perrilloux might be A.J. Foyt revisited. But Miles has to have images of mangled steel and deployed airbags dancing in his mind. There are, as said, also issues on defense -- will the line really be that good without Marcus Spears, will Cameron Vaughn be up to the task of playing middle linebacker -- and can the kickers go a month without missing an extra point. The thing that causes the greatest trepidation for LSU fans -- and for those of us in the media who vote in the various polls and preseason rankings -- is the change at the top. Nick Saban isn't as perfect as we remember him, but he was a proven, colossal success in his five seasons at LSU. You have to believe if he hadn't been lured away by Wayne Huizenga's mega millions to coach the Miami Dolphins the Tigers would have been a spot or two or three higher in the preseason rankings. Considering LSU has Tennessee, Florida and Auburn at home -- where the Tigers were a perfect 7-0 last year for the first time since 1972 -- LSU probably would have been the consensus pick to win the Southeastern Conference instead of Tennessee. But with Miles, there is just enough unease to downgrade the Tigers like a questionable stock on Wall Street. It's worth remembering that Miles won more games in the last four years at Oklahoma State than Saban did in his first four years at Michigan State before going to LSU after year five. It's just that Miles isn't adorned with the epithet "genius" as Saban was. A good solid job at a tough to win place like Oklahoma State isn't as sexy as the cache of trophies Saban won at LSU. So where do you figure these Tigers? In the final analysis before the big kickoff, how much upside do you grant LSU before you start counting up the deficits? First of all, talent, experience and a strong coaching staff -- probably stronger than any one Saban had -- say the Tigers can win every game. Every game. How often has that been said about LSU in the last 30-something years? The questions -- iffy quarterback, shaky kicking game, new head coach, at least five very tough opponents on the schedule even though most are at home -- says LSU can't win them all. The Tigers could do as badly as 8-3. Me, I'm down the middle with most things. I usually refuse to believe things are going to be as great, or as awful, as some will always predict. That's why I think LSU will drop a game, just one, still getting into the SEC Championship Game but maybe not into the BCS title tilt in the Rose Bowl. But I could be dead wrong. The pendulum could swing this team from the Rose Bowl to the Independence Bowl. After all the conjecture, speculation, predictions and downright worry, they're just going to have to play them all for us to find out. It should be a heck of a ride Printer Friendly Version Send this story to a friend Advertising   Copyright ? 1992-2005, 2theadvocate.com, WBRZ, Louisiana Broadcasting LLC and The Advocate, Capital City Press LLC, All Rights Reserved.

212	 Main Index Colleges Preps Pros King: Little room for error as Miles Era begins Another era passes. Time marches on. Tributes have been paid and farewells said to Nick Saban, who shoved and directed his LSU football teams to the most victories (48) ever recorded in a five-year period with the Tigers. A national championship, two Southeastern Conference titles and two Sugar Bowl crowns are history. Another coaching era begins, but with fan expectations at an all-time high for a new head coach. LSU/SEC/NATIONAL Miles takes on LSU challenge Tigers won't sneak up on anyone LSU's Niswanger studious, curious LSU's Williams makes presence felt Arizona State, Appalachian State to visit Rose marks end, or beginning, of era SEC West: LSU appears to top list | Capsules SEC East: Leak makes difference | Capsules Columns: Scott Rabalais | Sam King Les Miles has quite an act to follow. I have seen the coaching baton passed several times, from Paul Dietzel, to Charles McClendon and on and on. No handoff, however, may be more interesting than this one. Miles' job is not to rebuild, but to expand and further strengthen an already rock-solid football program. Already ranked near the top -- if not at the top -- of most preseason polls, Miles has little room for error to launch his era on solid ground. With nine starters returning on offense, seven back on defense and 47 lettermen scheduled to be back, LSU fans might have reason to feel the only thing between Tiger Stadium and the Rose Bowl, where the BCS National Championship Game will be played, is miles and Miles. The former Oklahoma State coach is not the first to fall heir to a bundle of talent and high expectations at LSU. If he fares as well as most of them in his first two years, everything should be quite well. Using All-SEC credentials as a measuring stick, several former coaches inherited some outstanding material over the years. When Dietzel left in 1961, McClendon inherited players who would gain 12 spots on All-SEC selections in his first two years. They helped usher in the McClendon era with a 16-5-1 start. Great players, surrounded by other outstanding players, make coaches look awfully good, just as good coaching can make good players become great players. When Jerry Stovall came aboard in 1980 after new coach Bo Rein died in a plane crash, the talent level was hurting. Stovall's players claimed only three first-team and two second-team All-SEC spots in two years as the Tigers went 7-4 and 3-7-1. Despite his four up-and-down years, Stovall was a genuine recruiter. He amassed a bundle of talent in trying to implement Nebraska's five-year plan. He, too, wanted to reload, not rebuild. Athletic Director Bob Brodhead nipped the reloading plan in the muzzleloader, fired Stovall and brought in his own man, Bill Arnsparger -- a wily, NFL defensive coordinator who knew what to do with talent. His players would earn eight first-team All-SEC spots and six second-team spots over the next two years as the Tigers posted marks of 8-3-1 and 9-2-1. An increased and overflowing load of talent was passed on to Mike Archer when Arnsparger went to Florida "just to talk" about becoming athletic director. If McClendon and Arnsparger had inherited great hands to play -- and they did -- then Archer was dealt a royal flush. It enabled Archer to have the greatest first-season record ever (10-1-1) for a Tiger head coach. His 18-5-1 mark is also the best record of any coach in his first two seasons at LSU. In the two-year period, Archer's players gained 13 first-team All-SEC spots in either the AP, Coaches or UPI polls -- with a half-dozen more claiming second or third-team mentions. In '88 alone, eight players were picked on someone's All-SEC first team. The amount of talent and experience was somewhat overwhelming. Now, the rest of the story. Then, it was goodbye to the five-year plan started by Stovall. The talent level bottomed out. Archer's teams floundered at 4-7 and 5-6 the next two seasons. The axe fell. When Curley Hallman arrived in '91, the cupboard of talent was basically empty. Only five spots, two firsts and three seconds, were gained on the All-SEC teams the next two years as Hallman's teams went 5-6 and 2-9. Hallman left LSU in much better shape than he found it. His successor, Gerry DiNardo, put the finishing touches on a good recruiting class by bagging heralded running back Kevin Faulk, who led the Tigers to 7-4-1 and 10-2 marks in DiNardo's initial two campaigns. DiNardo had six All-SEC first-team selections over the two-year period, including four first-team players in '96. DiNardo's last two teams fell to 4-7 and 2-8 before he was fired. Fans said he coached pretty good with Hallman's players, but couldn't do anything with his own. Saban could. Saban's first two teams went 8-4 and 10-3 as he instilled hard work and never quitting for 60 minutes into his players. Players gained eight first- and nine second-team slots on All-SEC teams the next two years. Needless to say, his record shows he put the program on a rock-solid foundation. It should not be surprising that the track record at LSU shows most coaches who came in and inherited outstanding talent did well. Great players make good coaches. In addition to a host of experienced lettermen and starters, Miles falls heir to two returning All-SEC first team selections and three second-team picks. Whether or not Miles' abundance of experienced talent will be enough for him to reach the expectations of fans remains to be seen. But, if Miles' first couple of years live up to those of the likes of McClendon, Arnsparger, Archer and Saban, it will be a lively town in Baton Rouge on Saturday nights.

213	 Main Index Colleges Preps Pros LSU's Niswanger studious, curious By CARL DUBOIS cdubois@theadvocate.com Advocate sportswriter Advocate staff photo by Bill Feig Rudy Niswanger (left) lifts up Skyler Green after LSU's late Capital One Bowl touchdown. Before a test, students have been known, from time to time, to secretly and illicitly scribble the answers to anticipated questions on their hands, taking the easy way out. LSU guard Nate Livings said he's seen teammate Rudy Niswanger do the opposite. "If he has a question on a test that he doesn't understand, he'll write the question on his wrist, and after the test he'll go back home and study it," Livings said. Such is the inquisitive mind of Niswanger, a fifth-year senior from Monroe who came back to LSU this season to be the starting center, postponing medical school for a year after graduating with a 4.0 grade point average in pre-med. Curious by nature, studious to a fault, Niswanger wants to be a doctor. He's not sure what kind, but he said he knows medicine is the place for him and his exploratory mind. "It's the type of career where you never have all the answers," Niswanger said. "There's always something else to research or search for, finding out what's going on with our selves, our bodies." Niswanger (pronounced "NICE-wahng-er") worked the last two summers with Bill Bankston, an orthopedic surgeon on LSU's medical staff. Sports medicine first hooked Niswanger on the idea of medical school, but he said he's keeping an open mind about the possibilities awaiting him after this football season. He's also excited about the possibilities within the season. LSU has a chance to win a championship or two, and that's one of several reasons Niswanger and offensive tackle Andrew Whitworth decided to return to LSU for their senior seasons. "Both guys made unselfish decisions to come back," LSU coach Les Miles said. "Rudy could have started medical school. Andrew could have gone on to the NFL, but he delayed getting a paycheck. They're both committed to being at LSU and pursuing a championship, and they're committed to their teammates." LSU/SEC/NATIONAL Miles takes on LSU challenge Tigers won't sneak up on anyone LSU's Niswanger studious, curious LSU's Williams makes presence felt Arizona State, Appalachian State to visit Rose marks end, or beginning, of era SEC West: LSU appears to top list | Capsules SEC East: Leak makes difference | Capsules Columns: Scott Rabalais | Sam King Niswanger said he and Whitworth talked about it last season, and their conversations became more intense at season's end. Standing in the lobby of the team hotel after the Capital One Bowl in Orlando, Fla., they discussed their options more thoroughly. A week later, Niswanger was married and went on his honeymoon. Whitworth had already announced he was staying. Niswanger was pretty sure he would too, but he said he and his bride talked and prayed about it on their honeymoon. "We knew we could afford it financially," he said, "and socially it was something we felt we wanted to do. Andrew and I talked about it, and we decided it would benefit us and benefit the team to come back this year. "We'd always said we would stay and play as long as LSU allowed us to, so we did." Whitworth and Niswanger were teammates for two junior high seasons at Ouachita Christian School in Monroe before Whitworth enrolled at West Monroe High as a freshman. They committed to LSU on the same radio program in Baton Rouge in 2001, and they've been teammates, preseason camp roommates and next-door neighbors in the locker room since. "Rudy's a guy who has overall great character and integrity," Whitworth said. "The way he carries himself, it shows what a smart guy he is. He's a guy who would never put himself in situations where he could have a problem. "He thinks ahead about everything. He's always alert to what is good, what is bad, where he should be, and he's always taking care of what he should be taking care of." Niswanger played three line positions at LSU but was mainly a guard, playing next to Whitworth, until center Ben Wilkerson suffered a season-ending knee injury on the last play against Vanderbilt in the eighth game last season. Niswanger became the center. "He did an unbelievable job," Whitworth said. "I think it showed the kind of guy he is. He's always prepared. He's always ready to play, and he's always a guy that feels obligated to the team to be ready to play and produce in the way that he should." Livings first met Niswanger when they attended LSU summer camps when Gerry DiNardo was coach of the Tigers. Livings said former LSU lineman Rodney Reed and Niswanger were helpful to him when he became eligible to play at LSU. "Rudy was like a field general out there," Livings said. "He and Rodney knew the offense." Livings and Whitworth said Niswanger isn't the kind of person who stands out in a crowd, despite his listed height of 6-foot-5 and weight of nearly 300 pounds. He's not shy, but he's not prone to being the center, if you will, of attention. "He's quiet, not shy," Whitworth said. "He gets to know his surroundings before he opens up much. When you get to know him, you can talk about grades, football, anything with him." Livings said he likes having Niswanger back this season. "He's the guy you look forward to working out with," Livings said. "He has a level of focus a lot of players don't have. It's unbelievable how he concentrates on things, in the classroom, in the meeting rooms." Teammates say Niswanger is almost like an assistant to offensive line coach Stacy Searels. Niswanger said he enjoys helping younger players learn the offensive system. "I try not only to be a player but a teacher to some of the younger guys," Niswanger said. "I remember how it was coming into this system. It's tough to learn everything. You get a lot of stuff thrown at you at one time. I try to make their burden lighter by explaining it in a way that helps them understand it better." Redshirt freshman Ryan Miller, No. 2 on the depth chart at center, said he appreciates learning behind someone as smart and gifted as Niswanger. "Everything's so easy for him," Miller said. "Sometimes he'll have to even explain it to coach Searels. He knows so many things, and he can play every position on the line. He knows pretty much everything on the offensive line." LSU offensive coordinator Jimbo Fisher agreed. "Sometimes he keeps the coaches straight," Fisher said. And he works without a cheat sheet -- on the field and in the classroom, although he said on occasion a teacher will see his handwriting on his arm or wrist after an exam and ask him about it. "It's gotten some attention before and almost gotten me into trouble, but it's obvious that it's just the question, not the answer, and that I'm not trying to hide it," Niswanger said of his unusual exam routine. "I just want to remember what it is so I can go find out the answer." That's just one of the reasons his teammates come to him when they have questions, and why they are glad to have him back. He is their on-the-field, walking, talking crib notes, front and center.

214	 Main Index Colleges Preps Pros LSU's Williams makes presence felt By RANDY ROSETTA rrosetta@theadvocate.com Advocate sportswriter Advocate staff photo by Patrick Dennis LSU's Kyle Williams (left) teaches a Sunday school class and guides evening youth classes. Some day very soon, Kyle Williams could be a busy man on Sunday afternoons. For now, the LSU senior has better things to do on the Sabbath. Williams, a 6-foot-2, 295-pound defensive tackle, devotes six days a week to the LSU football program. His undivided attention is focused on terrorizing quarterbacks, beating offensive linemen and playing as disruptive a roll as possible for a defense that's been one of the best in college football the last few years. The seventh day belongs to a higher power. When Sunday rolls around, Williams is up early and on his way to The Chapel on the Campus where he serves as a youth ministry intern for middle school and high school-age kids. As perplexing as it might seem for anybody in their right mind to volunteer to spend time with 12-18 year-olds, it makes even less sense for a big-time player in a big-time college program to give up his one partial day of rest. Between teaching a Sunday school class, attending service and guiding evening youth group classes, Williams also has to go to a team meeting and go through of series of healing-related running and stretching workouts. On the day of rest, Williams does anything but relax. LSU/SEC/NATIONAL Miles takes on LSU challenge Tigers won't sneak up on anyone LSU's Niswanger studious, curious LSU's Williams makes presence felt Arizona State, Appalachian State to visit Rose marks end, or beginning, of era SEC West: LSU appears to top list | Capsules SEC East: Leak makes difference | Capsules Columns: Scott Rabalais | Sam King That's not how Williams looks at it, though. Instead, he sees his service to youth and the church as a debt to be paid. "When I think of all the things football and LSU have given me -- a great education, the chance to play for a great program, the chance to maybe play in the NFL, 92,000 fans who love me -- this is just something I feel is a duty," Williams said. "I don't think I can come down here and just take, take, take. I wanted to give something back, and this gives me a chance to do that in a small way." Giving back means giving up time. Besides teaching Sunday school, Williams also squeezes time in with his mini congregation on Sunday nights and other times during the week. The focus is on the things a typical youth group does -- talks about God and what he means to different individuals, meals together, trips to amusement parks. "To the kids, he's like a big teddy bear hero of a guy," said Levie Chustz, the director of youth ministry at The Chapel on the Campus. "Kids that age are always looking for heroes, and with Kyle, he's right here where they can touch him and that makes a difference." Inevitably, though, the talk always gets around Williams' "day job." "On Sunday we talk a lot about football, of course," Williams said with a smile. "It's like a ritual. As soon as I walk in and sit down -- sometimes before I sit down -- they all surround me and want to know about the game. They ask me how I played, how the team played, how good the other team was -- the same stuff everybody wants to know about. "But it's important to me that we also talk about what's going on in their lives. I don't want it to be all about me because that's not why I'm there. I get just as much fulfillment from them as I hope they're getting from me." Maybe so, but the give is likely more valuable than the take. As a college football player in a community that gobbles up college football, Williams is a major public figure. The fact he may be one of the best defensive tackles in the country and could add the title All-American to his name after this season only adds to his aura. "To those kids Kyle works with, he's a big-time celebrity, so they want to spend time with him because of that, but they get more from it because he's such a good person," said LSU center Rudy Niswanger, one of Williams' closest friends. "A lot of who you turn out to be is based on who you're around, who influences you the most. And those kids who spend time around Kyle end up getting a great role model to follow." And unlike former NBA star Charles Barkley, that's exactly what Williams seems to be aiming for. Several years ago, Barkley earned lingering notoriety for saying he never wanted to be a role model. Williams saw the opportunity to do so, seized it with both big hands and has embraced it wholeheartedly ever since. "I really wanted to give them a positive example to follow," Williams said. "A lot of things kids have around them now or what they see on TV is negative stuff. They don't see the other side of life because there aren't that many people willing to be a role model. I wanted to live my life in front of the kids I'm around to show them there is a different way to do things, a right way." Williams never strayed that far from the right path when he was growing up in Ruston. Church was almost as big a part of his life as football. But it took the right person entering his life to convince Williams once and for all that he had something to give back. Shortly after arriving on LSU's campus in 2002, Williams went to a study hall and met a volleyball manager named Jill Myers. "Once we met, that was it for me. I knew right away," Williams said and then chuckled. "She played 'hard to get' at first, but she came to her senses." Nearly four years later -- May 28 to be exact -- the two were married. Along the way, Jill Williams helped encourage her husband-to-be to get more involved with the church, especially with the youth. Kyle Williams admits he hesitated at first. It meant not only giving up his Sunday free time but also Saturday nights after games. Just about anyone who's spent time in college understands how sacred Saturday night can be, particularly after a victory over Ole Miss or Auburn or Alabama. "I was going to church, but it was Jill who really got me engulfed a lot more than I'd ever been," Kyle Williams said. "I saw the way she carried herself and the way she treated people. She has so much affection for everybody she meets, and that rubbed off on me. Then once I got around the kids the first time, I realized how much it meant to them and to me." That impression stuck with Williams. Regardless of what happens on Saturday and how far he has to travel, Williams is up early on Sunday morning and in time for early service. That alone puts him in a small minority of college students. "He's so faithful to his service," Chustz said. "Sometimes he gets in at 4 in the morning and he's still here at 8 to teach his Sunday school class. The kids know that because most of them watch him on TV the night before. They respect the commitment he makes to be here with them." Added LSU offensive tackle Andrew Whitworth, "It says a lot about Kyle that he's got the strength of character to put his priorities in the right order. He made a commitment to put his life in God's hands first, and since then everything else comes next. That's the kind of character guy he is." As willing as Williams is to speak of his commitment to the church, he's even more expressive when he talks about what Jill means to him. He and Niswanger are the only married players on LSU's roster, and it's a distinction both are proud to claim. "This is the first football season we've been married, but it's already better than I ever imagined," he said. "When I go home, I know I've got a great support system there waiting for me. There's always somebody for me to talk to." In turn, Williams makes sure he returns that favor every Sunday. "Probably the biggest influence Kyle has on the kids is that he's so real," Chustz said. "They need someone who's not fake or a poser and that's what Kyle is."

215	 Main Index Colleges Preps Pros SEC West: LSU appears to top list By RANDY ROSETTA rrosetta@theadvocate.com Advocate sportswriter Sitting down to write this column, I was joined by a little devil on one shoulder and tiny angel on the other. Right away, the devil chimes in, "You're a hometown sportswriter. You can't really predict LSU to be the best team in the SEC West Division again, can you? Not this year -- big question mark at quarterback, four great defensive players gone, that Saban guy is roaming around on South Beach, yada, yada, yada." Then the angel took his turn in the pulpit. "The Tigers have to be the pick this year. That nice friendly Miles fella really pumped some life into Oklahoma State of all places and anybody who doesn't think JaMarcus Russell, Matt Flynn or that new kid can't be effective just doesn't have enough faith." Back and forth they went, espousing the pros, the cons. LSU/SEC/NATIONAL Miles takes on LSU challenge Tigers won't sneak up on anyone LSU's Niswanger studious, curious LSU's Williams makes presence felt Arizona State, Appalachian State to visit Rose marks end, or beginning, of era SEC West: LSU appears to top list | Capsules SEC East: Leak makes difference | Capsules Columns: Scott Rabalais | Sam King It'd make perfect sense for the devil to win out. After all, wannabe sportswriters are implored to avoid the dreaded "homer" tag. Sometimes, though, common sense prevails and trumps the urge to be cynical. Yeah, the Tigers quarterback trio of Russell, Flynn and freshman Ryan Perrilloux has some work to do as far as establishing consistency and reliability. And sure, Miles has a lot to prove in a much balmier pressure cooker than he dealt with in Stillwater. But talent-wise and experience-wise, no program in the SEC West, and maybe the entire league, stacks up to the Tigers. Before LSU can lay claim to its third SEC West crown in five years, the Tigers will have a few obstacles to conquer along the way. The Oct. 15 home game against Auburn looms large, but then don't LSU-Auburn games always wind up meaning something? The two Tigers have won or tied for the division championship in each of the last five years, with each making two appearances in the SEC Championship Game. The one dangerous road game that jumps out on LSU's schedule is a junket to Tuscaloosa in November. Still, barring a series of meltdowns between Labor Day and the day after Thanksgiving, it's hard to imagine LSU not making its third journey to Atlanta in the last five years. Number in parentheses indicates predicted finish. (1) LSU: As if there weren't enough comparisons between LSU and Auburn already, consider how conveniently the LSU home schedule sets up for a championship run and how similar it is to Auburn's 2004 slate. Last year, two of Auburn's biggest season-turning challenges were waged at Jordan-Hare -- LSU and Georgia. This year, LSU draws Tennessee, Auburn and Florida at home. And despite the lingering hangover from 2004, LSU's returning cast of players played a major role for a 9-3 team that was one botched extra point and one Hail Mary touchdown pass away from potentially going 11-1. Whoever emerges as the starter at quarterback will have time to settle in against North Texas and Arizona State and will also have the luxury of arguably the deepest and most loaded cache of skill-position offensive players in the country. Even without injured Alley Broussard, LSU running backs Joseph Addai and Justin Vincent could be -- here come those Auburn comparisons again -- the Cadillac Williams and Ronnie Brown of this season. The only problem Addai and Vincent might encounter is getting the ball enough. Not only because of the traffic jam in the backfield, but also because the Tigers' receiving corps won't leave offensive coordinator Jimbo Fisher any choice but to put the ball in the air. Dwayne Bowe, Buster Davis, Skyler Green, Xavier Carter and Early Doucet are all big-play threats. The offensive talent pool spreads to the line as well with the entire unit that started the Capital One Bowl back intact, anchored by All-America candidate Andrew Whitworth. The LSU defense absorbed some major losses, but the players likely to step into the void -- Chase Pittman at end, E.J. Kuale at linebacker, Ronnie Prude, Chevis Jackson and Sammy Joseph at the corners -- all have substantial Division I experience and should fit in well. Among the defensive starters back, Kyle Williams is among the country's best interior lineman and Cameron Vaughn should have a similar presence to Turner. Just as Corey Webster and Travis Daniels gave LSU one of the nation's best cornerback tandems for two years, Jessie Daniels and LaRon Landry will be counted among the country's top safety duos. Another major intangible for LSU is the addition of defensive coordinator Bo Pelini, whose intense ball-hawking MO seems to be a perfect fit with the Tigers' personnel. Talent level and preseason expectations don't always match up, especially with the rabid fan bases of the SEC. In this case, though, LSU seems poised to match the lofty goals its fans put in place for 2005. (2) ALABAMA: This pick is predicated on two major circumstances -- Brodie Croyle staying healthy and the Crimson Tide ending its three-game losing streak to Auburn in the Iron Bowl -- which matches Bama's second-longest skid to the Tigers. If those two things happen, combined with a Bama defense that figures to be as good as any in the SEC, the Tide should take a major step back toward being a factor in the West again. That Bama defense allowed Mike Shula's team to stick around in most games last season, but wasn't stout enough to offset the loss of Croyle in the third week. The bottom line was a mediocre 6-6 finish that dropped the curtain on Shula's honeymoon and shoved him squarely onto the hot seat. When healthy, Croyle is one of the best returning QBs in the league and would help balance the Bama defense. His health may be as important to his team as any other quarterback in the SEC. (3) AUBURN: These Tigers lost a huge amount of talent from their 13-0 SEC championship team, and will have to reload at key spots. There won't be reason to feel sorry for AU early in the year. Only one of Auburn's first six foes played in a bowl a year ago, which paves the way for the Tigers to stretch their winning streak to 19 games. But three of the last five games are at LSU, at Georgia and against Alabama, setting stage for a late-season swoon. Six weeks may be enough to replace the star-studded backfield of Jason Campbell, Williams and Brown, but likely won't be enough time to overcome road games in Baton Rouge and Athens. (4) OLE MISS: The Rebels should get a shot in the arm from wild-man new coach Ed Orgeron, and an even bigger boost from the softest schedule in the SEC. Ole Miss is the only West Division team with games against East bottom-feeders Vanderbilt and Kentucky and the Rebs' toughest nonconference game is at Memphis. Orgeron is the polar opposite of his predecessor, low-key David Cutcliffe, and brings the experience of seven years on Southern California's staff with him. But he has a lot of holes to fill -- five starters on offense and four on defense. Still there seems to be some talent on the Grove. Michael Spurlock starts at quarterback ahead of former West Monroe star Robert Lane and Ethan Flatt. They have a deep group of running backs for help with the rushing attack. (5) ARKANSAS: Besides Auburn, the Razorbacks endured the most major loss in the SEC when quarterback Matt Jones' career finally ended. Jones was the wild card who for three years seemed to give the Hogs a chance to win, but he wasn't able to help a porous defense that surrendered 24.5 points and nearly 400 yards a game a year ago. If Arkansas can somehow shore up a defense that returns nine starters and find a quarterback to step in for Jones, there seems to be enough talent on offense to put up competitive numbers. That might be necessary if the defense resorts to last year when it got peppered for 35 points or more in four of the six losses. A major key could be how Arkansas fares -- more specifically how bloodied the Hogs get -- on consecutive daunting road weekends at Southern California and Alabama. Hogs coach Houston Nutt is often credited with getting the most out of the least talent in the SEC, and this season might put that reputation to the test. (6) MISSISSIPPI STATE: Only Vanderbilt has lost more SEC games than the Bulldogs in the last four years, but there were at least a few signs of life a year ago in Sylvester Croom's rookie season. Croom and the Bulldogs will operate under the specter of probation for three more years, but do have some building blocks. Five State players made the All-SEC freshman team and the 'Dogs lost only three starters on each side of the ball. The major emphasis for Croom will be to inject some life into an offense that accounted for only 180 points last season and scored two touchdowns or less in seven games -- all losses.

217	 Main Index Colleges Preps Pros SEC East: Leak makes difference for Gators By CARL DUBOIS cdubois@theadvocate.com Advocate sportswriter Advocate staff photo by Travis Spradling Quarterback Chris Leak hopes to lead Florida to the top of the SEC East. Eleven times in the 13 seasons of divisional play in the Southeastern Conference, the Eastern Division champion has been either Florida or Tennessee. Go ahead and choose your favorite from among those two teams, because the winner of their Sept. 17 matchup will play in the SEC Championship Game in Atlanta. Georgia will be better than many people think, just not good enough to duplicate the success it had in winning the conference championship in 2002 and returning to the SEC title game a year later, where it lost to LSU. The East will provide a lot of entertainment this season. Tell me you won't be watching Nov. 12 when the Florida Gators travel to Columbia, S.C., to play in Steve Spurrier's new house. Spurrier vs. Phillip Fulmer will be the story line all week before the Oct. 29 game between South Carolina and Tennessee at the Volunteers' Neyland Stadium. That's assuming Alabama fans let Fulmer leave their state. The Crimson Tide hosts Tennessee on Oct. 22 in Tuscaloosa, Ala. Expect heightened security around Fulmer. Everyone is curious to see if new Florida coach Urban Meyer can win at the highest level after four solid seasons coaching at midmajor programs: two at Bowling Green, two at Utah. With FireRonZook.com retired, how long can Meyer stave off the inevitability of a Web site devoted to his dismissal? At least through the regular season, which will end with the Gators atop the SEC East. LSU/SEC/NATIONAL Miles takes on LSU challenge Tigers won't sneak up on anyone LSU's Niswanger studious, curious LSU's Williams makes presence felt Arizona State, Appalachian State to visit Rose marks end, or beginning, of era SEC West: LSU appears to top list | Capsules SEC East: Leak makes difference | Capsules Columns: Scott Rabalais | Sam King (1) FLORIDA: Chris Leak will be the difference. Tennessee has more returning starters than Florida, but the Gators have the SEC's best combination of quarterback experience and big-play ability in Leak. Meyer's spread offense has more skeptics than believers outside of Gainesville, Fla., and one of the most critical questions is how much Meyer will ask Leak to run the ball. Can Leak hold up if he takes too many hits? Isn't he better as a drop-back passer? During the summer, Meyer indicated he will pick his spots with Leak. That's a wise move, because Leak's receivers can get the job done. Some experts rate Florida's corps of receivers ahead of LSU's. The Gators will give up points. Defense will not be the hallmark of this team, but any team that wants to beat Florida will need to bring a clicking offense onto the field. Leak is older, wiser, more experienced and more confident than ever. Florida will beat Tennessee because Florida has the most stable quarterback situation among the SEC title contenders. Meyer doesn't have to spend the first few games figuring out what to do with the position. Leak is the man. Tennessee is not quite there, and Sept. 17 is right around the corner. If the game was later in the season, the pick here might be different, but largely on the strength of the arm -- and maturity -- of Leak, the Gators and Urban Renewal are No. 1 in the East. (2) TENNESSEE: The margin between Florida and Tennessee is razor thin. If there's another reason to go with the Gators, it's because the showdown between the teams will take place at the Swamp in Gainesville, Fla. Tennessee's only test before that is its season opener Sept. 3 against UAB. Yes, the Vols have a week off after that, but open dates are not always the advantage people think. You can be sure Fulmer would rather have more than one game in the books before traveling to Florida Field to play the Gators. Having an open date in Week 2 is no way to establish a sense of continuity and momentum, especially with uncertainty at quarterback. Will it be Erik Ainge or former LSU backup Rick Clausen? The guess here is Ainge will take the most snaps this season, despite Clausen's outstanding play in a 38-7 victory over Texas A&M in the Cotton Bowl. Tennessee has eight returning starters on defense, and Fulmer is coming off a season in which he and the Vols were the surprise champions of the East. That would mean a lot more if Tennessee didn't have such a troubled offseason, but off-the-field incidents are often an indication of other problems. The race will be interesting, but Florida's early season victory over the Vols will limit the suspense. (3) GEORGIA: David Greene is gone. David Pollack is gone. So is his motor. Coach Mark Richt had his hands full with disciplinary problems during the offseason, but that's not the only reason to bet against the Bulldogs winning the division. The two Davids received most of the attention during their careers, but Georgia will miss former free safety Thomas Davis more than it knows. Odell Thurman and Fred Gibson weren't exactly slouches, either. Clearly, the Bulldogs have talent. Richt was smart to give D.J. Shockley some snaps at quarterback while Greene was the starter, so Shockley doesn't come in cold as the new leader of the offense. But the combination of skill and chemistry that won two SEC East championships and a conference title in the last three seasons isn't there, and it will show. (4) SOUTH CAROLINA: Spurrier back in the SEC? Things just got more interesting. Don't look for the Gamecocks to challenge for a championship before 2007, but the talent pool in the state of South Carolina is better than the layman realizes. Lou Holtz knew this, but he couldn't take advantage, not even with the Gamecocks running afoul of NCAA regulations. Spurrier will win many recruiting battles against Clemson, and he's a strong enough presence to attract talent from all over the country. Give him time, and look out. And watch out for at least one stunning upset. (5) VANDERBILT: You want to see guys like Vanderbilt coach Bobby Johnson and quarterback Jay Cutler succeed. Johnson is personable, doesn't allow cursing by his players and has a good sense of humor about himself. Cutler walked straight out of casting central -- actually Santa Claus, Ind., home of former LSU quarterback Matt Mauck -- and onto the Vanderbilt campus as the consummate leader and big man on campus. There's just not enough talent to compete with the big boys in the division. After all, this is Vanderbilt we're talking about. (6) KENTUCKY: The Rich Brooks watch is on. Many think he won't finish the season as coach of the Wildcats. If he finishes behind Vanderbilt, he won't. David Cutcliffe? Dennis Erickson? Butch Davis? Go ahead and start the derby.

219	 Main Index Colleges Preps Pros Rose marks end, or beginning, of an era By SCOTT RABALAIS srabalais@theadvocate.com Advocate sportswriter The Kentucky Derby, also nicknamed the Run for the Roses, is thoroughbred racing's ultimate event. In 2005, the entire college football season shapes up as a Run for the Rose Bowl, this year's ultimate game -- and ultimately the end of an era of sorts. With the Rose Bowl serving as the BCS championship game, the circuit will have been completed on the current four-bowl BCS contract. Starting with the 2006 season, the Bowl Championship Series will expand to include a fifth game in which the championship will be played, while also serving to give teams from non-BCS conferences greater access to the multimillion dollar BCS pie. The first BCS championship game will be played Jan. 8, 2007, a week after the BCS bowls are completed. The showdown takes place in the Phoenix area, host site of the Fiesta Bowl. LSU/SEC/NATIONAL Miles takes on LSU challenge Tigers won't sneak up on anyone LSU's Niswanger studious, curious LSU's Williams makes presence felt Arizona State, Appalachian State to visit Rose marks end, or beginning, of era SEC West: LSU appears to top list | Capsules SEC East: Leak makes difference | Capsules Columns: Scott Rabalais | Sam King For the college football fans clamoring for a playoff system, the wait is at least five years and counting. After Phoenix hosts the BCS championship game, it will visit (in order) New Orleans, Miami and Pasadena, Calif., which brings us back to this year's big tilt in the Rose Bowl. Because of the new contract, this could be the last time one of the big four bowls actually serves as the championship game, a technical point perhaps, but a historical one that should be featured on episodes of ESPN's "Stump the Schwab" for years to come. While the BCS must wait another season to unveil its new championship format, its method for selecting the championship participating teams goes on display this season -- ready or not. Forced into action during the offseason when The Associated Press demanded its media poll no longer be included in the BCS formula, the BCS folks had to come up with something to fill the void. That something is the Harris Interactive College Football Poll. The Harris Poll, which premieres Sept. 25, is one third of the BCS formula. Another third includes the ever popular USA Today coaches' poll (formerly the USA Today/ESPN coaches' poll until ESPN yanked its name off the title) and a brain trust of a half-dozen computer polls. The new poll will feature 114 voting members, most of them former college football coaches and administrators, but about 20 percent media members as well. The AP poll will, of course, still crown its national champion regardless of the outcome of the BCS formula. That means regardless of the new BCS poll, there could still be BCS and AP national champions just as there was with LSU and Southern California two years ago. Just when it seemed the cluttered bowl landscape might be clearing up a bit as the Silicon Valley Bowl packed up its bowl full of computer chips and went home, a new bowl joined the fray. Once again there are 28 bowls on the schedule in the two frenzied weeks from Dec. 21-Jan. 4. That means 56 of the 119 in NCAA Division I-A will be rewarded with a bowl trip to somewhere -- many of them just for managing to go 6-5. San Diego is the latest market -- following New Orleans, Phoenix, Orlando and Dallas/Fort Worth -- to figure out that if hosting one bowl each holiday season is fun then two must be so much better. Welcome the Poinsettia Bowl, which debuts at 9:30 p.m. CDT Dec. 22. At least now if you're up late wrapping Christmas presents there's another game to watch.

220	 Main Index Colleges Preps Pros Jaguars seek complete effort for SWAC title By JOSEPH SCHIEFELBEIN jschiefelbein@theadvocate.com Advocate sportswriter Advocate staff photo by Bill Feig Southern center Lance Gerard (66) gets a face full while trying to block LaDerrick Brazil earlier this month. The prevailing motivation for this season's Southern University football team is it recalls the team's failure to close out its last two games. The Jaguars led the Bayou Classic and then the Southwestern Athletic Conference Championship Game in the fourth quarter and lost both. The first of those losses cost pride and made them sweat out Alabama State's win over Arkansas-Pine Bluff. The second, with Alabama State taking the lead with 6:23 to play, cost the school a shot at a second straight SWAC title. That time, 6:23, is emblazoned on the back of the team's media guide. The twist to all this is the 2004 team defined itself by making the spectacular so regular in the final quarter for the month of October to even care out a run to the title game. That's how this game is, though. The triumph is celebrated. The what ifs burn. Tough game. "It's learning how to get focused and playing hard for 60 minutes," SU head coach Pete Richardson said of the emphasis. "Once you realize you're going to get there, you realize a lot of people don't get that opportunity. When you do, you've got to win the championship, because you may not ever get back again. That's the drive and hunger we have to get back in a lot of the individuals." The preseason camp has been somehow harder, somehow more focused, more intense. Perhaps with the infusion of three new defensive coaches, there's a greater "no nonsense" feel than before. SOUTHERN/SWAC Jaguars seek complete effort for title Jaguars call on new quarterback Eugene's back, just like Grambling Schiefelbein: SWAC finally has it right "We're really stressing getting these guys tired and trying to get a lot out of them when we're in practice, because we lost two games in the fourth quarter," SU offensive coordinator David Oliver said. "They're trying to push through that." Richardson, a Midwesterner, has always been lauded for that "no nonsense" feel. And it's in eliminating players who had problem with the law, discipline or both, plus the addition of Oliver and the infusion of talent, that Richardson has steadied SU the last two seasons. In the process, Southern went from three seasons of struggles (when Grambling won three straight conference titles) to make the last two SWAC title games, winning the conference and the black college national titles in 2003. Those results led, in the off-season, to a three-year deal at $200,000 per year, securing Richardson as the highest paid coach in Division I-AA. Even with being harnessed with laughable facilities, his record has been impressive. Until he came along, the Jaguars had won two SWAC titles from 1961-1992. But from 1993-2003, Richardson led SU to five SWAC crowns and four black college national titles. "Our goal is twofold: graduate students and win the championship," Richardson said. Richardson has fashioned his modest dynasty with what he calls "overachiever types." He's had?six NFL draft picks in his first 12 seasons at Southern. This team looks no different in terms of talent. As he told them at a recent post-practice huddle, there are no superstars. And as he always tells them, the expectation is to win the championship. These are the key facets: "being fundamentally sound, having a knowledge of assignments and being mentally tough. The rest of it will take care of itself," Richardson said. To Richardson, there are no excuses, in this game or in life. As Richardson has known for a while, things are "tough on the Bluff." "I think we've got enough athletes on our team to win this championship," Richardson said. "We're going to be inexperienced at certain spots, but that doesn't mean you can't win the championship." For the second straight season, SU has to replace the SWAC Offensive Player of the Year at quarterback. And again, the incoming signal caller, sophomore J.C. Lewis this time, doesn't have much experience. But the more pressing concern this season is rebuilding a defense that bears little, if any, resemblance to last season's other than the continued use of the 4-3 scheme (though SU did flirt with the 3-4 in spring practice). A staggering 13 of its top 15 tacklers are gone. Plus, the entire staff is new, with three assistants (defensive line coach David Geralds, outside linebackers coach Daryl Daye and defensive backs coach Jack Phillips) getting hired in either the spring or summer (all after spring practice) and veteran Terrence Graves taking over as defensive coordinator. The only returning starter among the linebackers and defensive backs is senior strong safety Darwon Hammond, who lost his starting job early last season (but nevertheless earned valuable playing time). The top returning tackler, senior Rene Gettridge, who moved to drop linebacker from end (where he had 36 tackles and a team-best five sacks). SU gets back senior end Kevin Mack, who missed most of last season with a ruptured Achilles' tendon, after appealing to the NCAA for a sixth season of eligibility. The former Oregon transfer led Southern in sacks in 2003. The line looks to be strengthened by transfers Joe Sykes (from West Virginia), James Carter (from Pearl River Community College), Julian Lowe (from Tulane) and Kendrell White (from Northwestern State). Also, senior end Rayland Johnson and tackle Keshawn Conner are back after the former nonqualifiers got a fourth year of eligibility, like Gettridge (with all three missing spring workouts). Junior David Brooks and Pearl River transfer Johnny Berry will be counted on to solidify the linebackers. Redshirt freshman Michael Williams takes over at left cornerback; secondary gets remade for the second straight season. What Southern has for sure: a veteran offensive line, a strong group of receivers and depth at running back and tight end. Guard Lunda Wells (preseason All-SWAC first-teamer) and center Brandon Jones (preseason All-SWAC second-teamer) have been mainstays. Guard Lance Gerard is versatile, and right tackle Jacobi Thierry, a sophomore who redshirted two seasons, turned in a solid debut season a year ago. All-SWAC wide receiver James Vernon (730 yards and six TDs) headlines the receivers, but the smallish senior has been moved to the outside in hopes of eliminating the litany of injuries that have kept him off the field. Also back are seniors Antonio Overstreet (510 yards and seven TDs) and Emile Bryant (498 yards, four TDs). The running back corps has senior power back Steel Adams (388, three TDs) and junior scatback Jamaal Huff (169 yards rushing/160 yards and one TD receiving). Plus, sophomores Larry Nicholls and Devin Herbert have had impressive offseasons. "Down on the Bluff, it's tough," Richardson said. "They don't expect you to just replace players; they expect you to win. That's what I try to sell to my players."

221	 Main Index Colleges Preps Pros Schiefelbein: SWAC finally has it right By JOSEPH SCHIEFELBEIN jschiefelbein@theadvocate.com Advocate sportswriter When Prairie View and Grambling got into that postgame brawl last season in Dallas, did the brawl count for one team and not the other? That's how the joke went. Actually, since PV and Grambling were in the same division, the brawl did count for both, and the Southwestern Conference had to suspend players from both teams and not just one team during the following week. That's how ridiculous the SWAC race was last season. For games involving teams from opposite divisions, the conference used a formula, with games like Alabama State and Arkansas-Pine Bluff counting for UAPB but not Alabama State. That foolishness was in effect even before the conference embarrassed itself a year ago by not being able to get teams to play each other. SOUTHERN/SWAC Jaguars seek complete effort for title Jaguars call on new quarterback Eugene's back, just like Grambling Schiefelbein: SWAC finally has it right But the conference has finally done the right thing. After having only divisional games count in 1999, a rotational format work (with some games between SWAC teams not counting at all) from 2000-03 and last year's little bit of foolishness, all games involving two SWAC schools on the field at the same time will count this season. So, for the first time since 1998, if you pull out your schedule card, every game between a conference team, regardless of division, will count. All the games count. It's so simple. It's so refreshing. It's so easy. Of course, the SWAC title game is still redundant and unnecessary and has never been developed into the marquee finish the league has hoped for, but we digress. Pine Bluff and Valley? Count it. Southern and Jackson State? It's good. Alabama State and Texas Southern? Yep. Grambling and Alabama A&M? Two SWAC teams, right? Uh-huh. Then it must be a SWAC game. Now that we've settled that business, how does that change the race during the regular season? Grambling coach Melvin Spears: "If you lose early, it puts you behind the eight ball." Alabama State coach Charlie Coe: "You could lose two or three games and be in the championship ballgame, because you win your division. It's tough, but it's an opportunity we look forward to. Playing in the championship game, being able to wear our championship rings and be able to call yourself champions, that's always outstanding for our players." Southern coach Pete Richardson: "You still have East-West. The key is, at the top part of the schedule, you have to be ready to go. Most teams, as the season goes on, improve if they don't have any injuries. If you mess around and lose a game up top that you're not supposed to lose, then you have to open up the papers on Sunday to see if somebody knocked somebody off to give you an opportunity." Alabama A&M coach Anthony Jones: "It's going to make every ballgame an important game. It used to be you could play somebody and lose that game, knowing it's not a conference game, so to speak, and it didn't matter. This year, everybody's important. It levels the playing field for everybody. It's something we all have to be ready for." Spears has a point. This isn't basketball or baseball where you've got so many games to make up (plus, multiple teams make those tournaments). So you don't want to lose early, because every loss starts to build pressure on the next game. Then again, Coe has a point as well, because the importance of each race is winning the division. Sometimes, that might take 9-0 to beat the other guy's 8-1. Sometimes, that could take a 6-3 to better a 5-4. An early loss won't necessarily hurt, but you'll only know when the race is over or at least well down the road of the season how many losses you can absorb and still be in the race. On the rise Mississippi Valley State. Quarterback Aries Nelson gives the Delta Devils a bona fide gamebreaker. And Valley coach Willie Totten saw his young guys get better. If they finish the games they weren't able to a year ago -- like against Southern -- watch out. The warning here is the Eastern Division historically has been deeper and tougher than the Western Division, which has annually been a two-team race. On the decline Southern. The Jaguars have too many holes to make up for on defense. And keep in mind, SU wasn't dominating on defense last season. The last time the Jaguars had so much to make up for was in the 2000 season, when SU had to rebuild after a devastating defense in the '99 season. Given that the Western Division hasn't been wide-open -- even with Arkansas-Pine Bluff and Prairie View making strides last seasons -- the slide may not be much. What helps Southern is that so many divisional games are in November. So barring a complete collapse early, that means SU shouldn't be out of the divisional race. If that's so, and if the young players grow, and history has shown Richardson's teams do that during the season, they could still have a chance to win the division. Say hello to... Well, at least reintroduce yourself to Grambling quarterback Bruce Eugene. One of the conference's most dynamic players and engaging personalities is back after the NCAA granted him a sixth season of eligibility in March. He gives Grambling a healthy dose of swagger as well as playmaking ability. Say goodbye to... Southern's hold on the SWAC Offensive Player of the Year award. Quarterbacks Quincy Richard (2003) and Thomas Ricks (last season) put up huge numbers and were consummate leaders in offensive coordinator David Oliver's system the last two years. Players like Eugene, Nelson and Alabama State's tandem of quarterback Tarvaris Jackson and running back Keldrick Williams, along with Alcorn State wide receiver Charlie Spiller are all in the running. But wait. Southern still has a chance at the award for three reasons. Even though the Jaguars break in a new quarterback in sophomore J.C. Lewis, Oliver has a proven star-making system (plus a group of veteran wide receivers, a formula Richard used). Senior wide receiver James Vernon, when healthy, is as dynamic a talent as there is in the conference. And SU's defense is so raw and unproven that the offense may have to put up big numbers. On the hot seat Jackson State's James Bell enters the third and final season of his contract with little to show for his first two seasons but a long line of unhappy fans and alumni. The situation was so bad for Bell, 6-17, that the school had to issue a short news release just saying he would be back for this season. This is no longer Jackson State football. At the finish Grambling and Alabama State will get to the SWAC Championship Game. And Alabama State is the more complete team.

222	 Main Index Colleges Preps Pros Jaguars call on new quarterback By JOSEPH SCHIEFELBEIN jschiefelbein@theadvocate.com Advocate sportswriter Advocate staff photo by Mark Saltz Southern quarterback J.C. Lewis (12) uis 13-for-21 for 57 yards and a touchdown in his career. Once more, the time has come to introduce a new Southern University quarterback, the school's seemingly annual rite of fall. Meet sophomore J.C. Lewis. Wouldn't it be nice to have the same guy back next year, too? Especially if you could return a Southwestern Athletic Conference Offensive Player of the Year just once? "Will that be a luxury?" fourth-year offensive coordinator David Oliver smiled. Oliver turned Quincy Richard, in 2003, and Thomas Ricks, last season, into SWAC headliners despite neither of the two having much experience. Richard threw for a school-record 3,430 yards and 33 touchdowns. Ricks, in one less game and with a new group of wideouts, threw for 2,786 yards and 24 TDs, ran for 694 yards and another nine TDs and even caught a 55-yard touchdown pass. The problem was, poof, they were gone after one breakout season. The good thing is, the way the two played showed the system works. "The thing you learn is there's no substitute for experience or repetitions," Oliver said. "What we've figured out is we have to accelerate their development by really forcing a lot of reps and a lot of knowledge on them, in the film room, in practice, through drills, through repetition. SOUTHERN/SWAC Jaguars seek complete effort for title Jaguars call on new quarterback Eugene's back, just like Grambling Schiefelbein: SWAC finally has it right "It's paid dividends for us, the way we've done it." Once again, SU doesn't have that luxury. What it has is another promise of what could be. Like Ricks before taking over last season, Lewis has limited experience. Going into last season, Ricks had thrown 23 passes in his entire career. And no touchdown passes. Going into this season, Lewis is 13-for-21 for 57 yards, all last season. But he at least has thrown for one touchdown. The key in his transition is he's been in system for three years. Lewis, who came to Southern in summer 2003 and redshirted as a true freshman, has spent time in the weight room and the film room (Oliver's office). The Walnut Creek, Calif., native had three summers, three spring practices, three fall practices and two seasons as a backup. "I can't say enough about the job J.C. has done in taking command of the system and running the offense," Oliver said. "He's making great decisions and he's raising the level of the play of those around him." This is another way the system works, in the long-term sense: While waiting his turn, Lewis said he learned from Ricks, who had learned from Richard. "You have to always be prepared," Lewis said. "Sitting behind Ricks, working with Ricks, I saw how he was when Quincy was out there, how he was always game-ready. That helped me just be prepared. "When I got out there, I didn't try to do too much, just work within the system, and the system will take care of things." SU coach Pete Richardson said the key is shaping the system to fit what the personnel, at whatever position, can do. Ricks had the physique to be a powerful runner. Richard, exceptionally quick but asked to stay in the pocket more because of the injury problems he had in 2002, had a varied and skilled cast of wideouts. This much we know about Lewis: At 5-foot-10, he isn't in the plus 6-foot range like the other two. He's a left-hander. And Richardson calls Lewis a "pinpoint passer." Center Brandon Jones said Lewis' smaller size could mean the line has to open more throwing lanes for what he anticipates will be more of a pocket passer. "He's ready. He can get the job done," Jones said. "He has a good group surrounding him. I think he'll be fine." While Richard had an easygoing, almost jovial way, Ricks was fiery. Lewis likely may use some California cool (even though Lewis' parents have since moved from the San Francisco area). "(The team can) rally around his calmness," Oliver said. "He's so calm, almost to the point of seeming too laid back, but he's an intense competitor. He's going to be a hard kid to rattle." The intangible is important, because Richardson always preaches having a quarterback who acts as a leader. Both Richard and Ricks excelled at that attribute. "The rest of these guys have played, and they've built confidence in the quarterback, because they know when he got in there, he made some positive things happen," Richardson said. Richardson consistently has praised the way Lewis, a mechanical engineering major who has made the school's dean's list, has gone about being a backup, never moping, even for a guy who threw for 7,372 yards and 57 touchdowns in high school. Plus, Lewis is already a proven leader, being named a team captain three times. "He understands it's his turn to elevate his level of play," Richardson said. "We're excited about giving him the opportunity to do that. We're confident enough he can do the job for us." For Lewis, that leadership process accelerated during the summer at voluntary conditioning. "He's going to be good," wide receiver Junior Joseph said. "Now, he has a lot more confidence. He feels more comfortable with the different personnel. He understands different players run different routes." Through the spring and summer, Jones said he's seen Lewis become more vocal. To a point, he's still a sophomore surrounded by veterans. "He leads by example," Oliver said. "He's always where he's supposed to be and produces at a regular level. The team can certainly rally around that." But can the young kid sling the ball? Yep. "He's fun to coach, because he's just a kid who loves to throw the football," Oliver said. To that end, Lewis said he always loves throwing the ball, seeing that as the quarterback's first job. "I know what to do. The receivers and linemen all know what to do," Lewis said. "We're going to put it all together and make it work."

223	 Main Index Colleges Preps Pros Eugene's back, just like Grambling By JOSEPH SCHIEFELBEIN jschiefelbein@theadvocate.com Advocate sportswriter Bruce Eugene Grambling's back. For proof, there's no need to consider much more than the return of quarterback Bruce Eugene. And with Eugene, who was granted a sixth season of eligibility after blowing out his left knee in the season opener a year ago, comes considerable swagger. Not to mention play-making ability. And even entertainment. Who else could tag Birmingham, Ala., the home of the Southwestern Athletic Conference Championship Game, as "Gramblingham?" As always, Eugene has the numbers to back up the claim. Even though they've finished second to rival Southern in the Western Division the last two seasons, the Tigers nevertheless have won more SWAC title games (three) than any other team in the six-year history of the event. Despite a 6-5 mark a year ago, Eugene's return gave the Tigers eight preseason All-SWAC selections and earned Grambling the nod to dethrone Southern in the preseason SWAC poll. "I feel as though God has blessed me by giving me another year," said Eugene, a Division I-AA All-American whom the school was hyping as a Heisman hopeful a year ago. "I'm just happy to be here, with coach and the young guys. There were a lot of guys who wanted to play with me, but didn't get the chance. Now they will." In a school known for its fixtures, Eugene, who has made more Southwestern Athletic Conference media days (three) than four of the league's 10 coaches, is the latest version. He is, and has been, the face of Grambling football lately. SOUTHERN/SWAC Jaguars seek complete effort for title Jaguars call on new quarterback Eugene's back, just like Grambling Schiefelbein: SWAC finally has it right "You compare it to the Williams boys (in the 1970s)," Grambling coach Melvin Spears said. "Doug for four years. Mike for three. Bruce Eugene has been at Grambling for six years. He falls in that category. "What you see is one of the most prolific passers in Grambling history. The only record he hasn't eclipsed yet is the touchdown record. ... Doug played in a Wing-T and Bruce played in a wide-open offense. It's just ungodly the numbers he's put up in two years." Eugene has thrown for 9,122 yards and 84 touchdowns and rushed for 1,050 yards and 16 more TDs. "I see a much more mature Bruce Eugene, a guy who has great patience, a guy who understands our scheme very, very well," Spears said. "I look forward to him being the leader on the field. As you know, most of the calls on the field come from Bruce Eugene. That's the way we've taught him. I can't wait to see him light it up." Because of the knee injury, Eugene's weight will be closely watched this season. Eugene had ballooned to 308 pounds (on his 6-foot-1 frame) in May, when he graduated in leisure studies. He spent four weeks at a Duke University clinic and was down to around 270 by late July. He wants to be at least 250 by the time the season starts. And he and Spears are sharing in a diet limiting each to 1,800 calories per day (though Spears said that could be 2,500 during the season to keep Eugene's energy up). Eugene found out in April, just before spring practice, that the NCAA had approved his petition for a sixth season of eligibility. "It was a dream come true," Eugene said. "(The worrying) was over. I didn't have any doubts anymore. I was so happy to be back." Eugene isn't the only Grambling player on the the all-conference preseason teams. Senior left offensive tackle Jonathan Banks (from McKinley High), senior defensive tackle Lennard Patton (from Glen Oaks), junior right offensive tackle Andre Bennett, senior running back Ab Kuuan and junior fullback Reuben Mayes made the first team. Patton had missed all of last season because of academic problems. And in addition to Eugene, junior defensive end Jason Hatcher, senior linebacker Dimitri Carr, senior free safety Jermaine Mills (also from McKinley High) and sophomore kick returner Landry Carter were on the second team. Kuuan (637 yards and 10 touchdowns) and Mayes had 215 of Grambling's 279 rushing yards as the Tigers wore down Southern and rallied to win the Bayou Classic 24-13. That win helped Spears, a longtime offensive coordinator who was an interim coach last season, gain a five-year contract as the head coach. Grambling must replace black college All-American defensive end Kenneth Pettway, who was drafted by the Houston Texans, and place-kicker Brian Morgan. But there are nine starters back on offense, including SWAC Freshman of the Year Brandon Landers (at quarterback), and seven on defense. Plus, Eugene is back. "It was a blessing he got hurt, to give him an opportunity to come back, see some things from afar, to understand this game is the game of life," Spears said of Eugene. "There are a lot of ups and downs, a lot of trials and tribulations. You just have to roll with whatever it may be. "He had an outstanding offseason, conditioning that knee. He's just like new."

224	 Main Index Colleges Preps Pros ULL looks for winning season after close calls By WILLIAM WEATHERS wweathers@theadvocate.com Advocate sportswriter Advocate staff photo by Bryan Tuck Quarterback Jerry Babb led ULL last year by completing 223 of 385 passes for 2,345 yards. LAFAYETTE -- The operative words during the Rickey Bustle era at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette have been close, closer and closest. The Ragin' Cajuns managed to take that to another extreme last season and in the process extended the school's longest losing streak. Of the 24 losses during Bustle's tenure 11 have been by seven points or less with six those coming by fewer than five points. Adding to UL-Lafayette's hardship a year ago was a stretch of six games to close the season, a span that included five losses -- all in the Sun Belt Conference -- by an average of 5.2 points. That left the Cajuns with a 4-7 record, their third straight losing season under Bustle and ninth consecutive. "It was very frustrating being so close," Bustle said. "You got to look around the corner but you couldn't come around the corner. In a positive way that's the difference, I hope, in our football team this year. Whether you win all of those close ones. ... I don't know. If you can win a couple of those then you're winning more than you're losing and that makes a difference." The players have certainly tried to do their part during summer conditioning and fall drills. "Everybody's been working out hard," UL-Lafayette sophomore strong safety Lamar Morgan said. "Everybody just wants win around here so bad. It's not just winning. We just want to play as a team. We're focusing on our team and working on things that we can do." The agonizing margin of error has acted more as catalyst than a deterrent for a team that returns 17 starters from a year ago. STATE PREVIEWS La. College | La. Tech La.-Lafayette | La.-Monroe McNeese St. | Nicholls St. NW State | SE La. | Tulane "It's close, I can feel it," UL-Lafayette junior offensive tackle Brandon Cox said. "I think we're one of the most talented teams in this conference. We have to take that talent and come together, build a strong team chemistry and once we do that, we'll be very successful." Cox, a preseason All-Sun Belt choice, is part of the reason there remains a strong sense of optimism at UL-Lafayette, which was picked fourth by the league's coaches. The Ragin Cajuns have eight starters back on offense, led by versatile junior Jerry Babb at quarterback, running back Chester Johnson, fullback Dwight Lindon, wide receiver Bill Sampy along with four of the team's five linemen. "Last year we were in the top two in just about every major category," Babb said. "I think we're very capable of doing the same thing if not better." Babb, who will be backed up by redshirt freshman Michael Desormeaux, led UL-Lafayette in total offense per game (285.5), completing 223 of 385 passes for 2,345 yards, 13 interceptions and 12 touchdowns. He also was the team's top rusher with 498 yards and four scores. "We've come close," Babb said. "We're making progress, we really are. It's just we have to win some games. We need to get over that edge and score that one touchdown." Sampy earned All-Sun Belt distinction last season with 57 catches for 776 yards and six touchdowns. After Sampy, though, the Cajuns have 11 receivers with a total of five receptions. "But having an older quarterback, I think that helps some and Jerry's going to need to be a little patient with some things," Bustle said. "If you're going to have some inexperience that's probably the easiest place to have it. I'd hate to have a young secondary like that or another position." The 6-foot-7, 295-pound Cox, who has started in 23 straight games, has flip-flopped sides of the line with sophomore Jesse Newman and moved back to right tackle. Senior Greg Hodges returns, but has moved from left guard to center and senior Justin Ernest will start at right guard ahead of Bishop Sullivan graduate Zach Leger. "We always want to come in with the mindset of rushing the football and no matter who's behind us, we're going to open up holes," Cox said of a ground game that increased to 152.7 yards per game last year. "We have confidence in the guys behind to hit those holes and do what they do best with the ball. I think we're going to be pretty solid up front." Bustle's biggest concern on defense is replacing productive safeties C.C. Brown and Antwain Spann, the team's top two tacklers last season, to go with a front seven that includes defensive ends Tony Hills (30 tackles, two sacks) and Eugene Kwarteng (28 tackles). Former Parkview Baptist standout linebacker Brenton Burkhalter is projected as a backup to Mark Risher. "We're still going to be inexperienced, but not completely inexperienced," Bustle said. "We've got a lot of guys back that we played in the some games. We've got some plays under our belt and that's exciting to us." Bustle said he was encouraged by the play of his defense against the run during the second half of the season, a unit that also ranked 11th nationally against the pass. Linebackers Tyler Norman and Wes Simon are the Cajuns leading returning tacklers with 49 and 38 stops, respectively. Cornerbacks Michael Adams (37 tackles) returns to lead a secondary that also includes ex-St. Helena Central standout Johnny Felders at strong safety behind Morgan, who missed last season with a knee injury. Senior place-kicker Sean Comiskey is back for his final season, 10 field goals shy of the school record of 35. He led the Cajuns in scoring with 66 points a year ago, a total that included 14 field goals, the most since 1994. "I'm really excited because this our team starting to come through, what we've worked so hard to get to," Bustle said. "When you look out you're looking at a team that you've recruited. I think there's a real true enthusiasm about what we're doing. These kids think differently. I know they believe."

225	 Main Index Colleges Preps Pros ULM's expectations high after last season's finish By WILLIAM WEATHERS wweathers@theadvocate.com Advocate sportswriter Advocate staff photo by Bill Feig Former Glen Oaks star and offensive juggernaut Steven Jyles returns for his senior season at ULM. The University of Louisiana at Monroe finished last season with five victories in its last seven games. For a program that hasn't enjoyed a winning season since 1993, the Indians' 5-6 record -- their best in five years -- nearly qualifies as a breakthrough. The upshot of the conclusion to the 2004 season was apparent several months later in spring training and visible once again during summer conditioning. "The guys couldn't wait for spring to start," UL-Monroe senior quarterback Steven Jyles said. "They came out with a lot of confidence. The defense was flying around, the offense was really competing. Things kind of turned after we got a couple of wins. Everybody's playing with a different attitude." Now comes the next logical question for UL-Monroe. Can the Indians capitalize on the positives created over the last nine months to finally forge a winning season? The return of 19 starters, led by Jyles, have the Indians primed to do just that. "We have high expectations," said UL-Monroe coach Charlie Weatherbie, who is 6-17 entering his third season. "Of course everyone this time of the year has high expectations. I believe we have an opportunity to have a real fine football team. It's going to be exciting to see it all come together; to see the leadership kind of mold and form and take place on this team." Weatherbie began to see the foundation for this year take shape after UL-Monroe dug itself out of an 0-3 hole to start last season. STATE PREVIEWS La. College | La. Tech La.-Lafayette | La.-Monroe McNeese St. | Nicholls St. NW State | SE La. | Tulane The Indians reeled off three straight victories before a 15-point loss to Sun Belt Conference champion North Texas State. They responded with two wins over the final three weeks of play, including a season-ending 13-10 victory over arch-rival UL-Lafayette. "To be able to end the season with a win and be able to win five out of the last seven was good," Weatherbie, the architect of turning around programs at Utah State and the Naval Academy. "I just see a lot more confidence. I see guys believing in one another and believing in their teammates. If you can do both of those then you've got a chance to be successful." The return of Jyles, a graduate of Glen Oaks, provides UL-Monroe with plenty of ammunition on offense. Jyles led Sun Belt Conference in total offense a year ago with 2,909 yards, pushing his career total to 7,563 yards -- the league's best mark. He also stands on the threshold of establishing several school records, including total offense (7,802). "As Steven goes so does the team," Weatherbie said. "Steven Jyles will be a catalyst on this football team, not just for the offense, but for the total team. He's a great team leader. He's the kind of young man you want out front. He's very intelligent. He's the kind of guy you want leading your football team." Jyles' 587 rushing yards, the most by a UL-Monroe quarterback since 1965, was the direct result of the Indians giving him more freedom to run. "This offense pretty much gives me the chance to be creative," Jyles said. "There are a lot of plays where I'm the primary source and what I do determines the outcome of the play. I like that role. I like having my hands on things, having a say-so in what happens with the team." Weatherbie said Jyles will have plenty of weapons at his disposal. Running back Mason Denham, who rushed 125 times for 529 yards and two touchdowns, is expected to be at full strength following knee surgery that forced him out of spring drills. Kevin Payne, who also doubles at safety, will return in the backfield after gaining 976 yards and scoring six touchdowns in 2003. Jyles' top target, 6-foot-6 Drouzon Quillen, was solid last season after knee surgery in '03. He led the Indians with 44 catches for 758 yards and seven touchdowns. Former Woodlawn High standout RoShon Jacobs saw his productivity slip from 25 to 10 catches for 110 yards last season. The Indians also feature preseason All-Sun Belt tight end Joey Trappey of Catholic High-New Iberia (20-261) and an offensive line that returns three starters (tackle Kyle Cunningham, guard Adam Hill and center Patrick Avinger). "Offensively we're going to be real good," Jyles said. "I think our offensive line should really open up the rushing game more this year because we've got a lot of great backs in the backfield. We should put up more points." UL-Monroe's defense lost two key members, including safety Chris Harris to the Chicago Bears, but the Indians' strength is clear with four returning linemen led by end Brandon Guillory. "He's a guy that NFL scouts are really excited about," Weatherbie said. Guillory, a former walk-on, ranked sixth on the team last season with 47 tackles, including 5 1/2 quarterback sacks for 38 yards in losses. Tackle Dilandos Johnson led UL-Monroe's interior linemen with 28 tackles with four for losses. Converted running back Jason Schuele was fourth on the team in tackles with 60 from his linebacker position and is expected to anchor that position along with former Capitol High standout Harry Bradley, the team's weakside linebacker. Weatherbie said free safety Shelton Williams, who had two interceptions, actually has more talent that Harris in the secondary and punter Joel Stelly of Cecilia, a Ray Guy candidate with a 45.10 average -- the nation's sixth-best in '04 -- further bolster the Indians' chances. "I feel we're right there, we've just got to jump that hump," Jyles said. "We finished strong last year and I think it's going to carry on this year. The way the guys are talking, they've got a lot of confidence. I think this is going to be the year where we have a pretty good season."

226	 Main Index Colleges Preps Pros Ricard to make Tulane go By LES EAST Special to The Advocate Lester Ricard NEW ORLEANS -- In the last year, Lester Ricard has gone from a rusty, neophyte college quarterback to a record-setting one and the unquestioned leader of Tulane's offense. Ricard was redshirted as a freshman at LSU in 2002 and sat out 2003 after transferring to Tulane. That left him nearly three years removed from his final game at Amite High School when he started his first game with the Green Wave in the 2004 season opener. In between he had to win a three-way battle in fall camp to become the starter. "Last year I didn't know the real college atmosphere and how it feels to be in a real game," Ricard said. "Now, since I have a year under my belt this year, I know what to expect when I step on the field. I know the ups and downs to expect." Last year started with a down as the time off and inexperience showed, especially in a 28-7 loss to Mississippi State in the season opener. Ricard completed 16-of-31 passes for 135 yards. He threw one touchdown and two interceptions. "That was probably the worst game I ever played in my life," Ricard said. "I'm kind of embarrassed at the way I played." Ricard's performance improved dramatically after the first month. In the first four games, he completed 56 percent of his passes for an average of 135 yards per game. He threw six touchdowns and six interceptions. STATE PREVIEWS La. College | La. Tech La.-Lafayette | La.-Monroe McNeese St. | Nicholls St. NW State | SE La. | Tulane In the last five games -- he missed the last two-plus games because of a broken wrist -- he completed 65 percent of his passes for an average of 268 yards per game. He threw 15 touchdowns and three interceptions. The Green Wave has little experience behind Ricard. Last year's backup, Richard Irvin, transferred to Harvard. Junior Nick Cannon and redshirt freshman Scott Elliott have had injury problems. True freshman Anthony Scelfo, the head coach's nephew and son of offensive coordinator Frank Scelfo, could be a factor. Ricard has less familiar targets to throw to this season as wide receivers Roydell Williams, the Conference USA leader in touchdown receptions, and Chris Bush, the second-leading receiver last season, both ran out of eligibility. Damarcus Davis (16 receptions, 246 yards, one touchdown) is the leading returning receiver. The other top receivers are senior Bubba Terranova (11-148-1), junior Fred Smith (10-42-0) and three players who haven't caught a pass -- junior Preston Brown, sophomore Kenneth Guidroz, and redshirt freshman Michael Batiste. "We don't have a Roydell Williams or a Chris Bush as far as play-making ability," Scelfo said. "But we've got five or six guys that can get open, catch the ball and separate." Tulane has a solid 1-2 punch at running back in senior Jovon Jackson and sophomore Matt Forte, both of whom rushed for 624 yards last season. Sophomores Ray Boudreaux and Ade Tuyo, who played some fullback last season, and freshman Christian Ducre give Scelfo his deepest stable of running backs. "I don't think there are many players at the running-back position today that can play 70 plays a game, 11 games a year," Scelfo said. "We need guys that can make a difference when they're out there, and I think we have three guys who can do that. We're still light at fullback. We've got to figure out what we're going to do there." The offensive line has evolved from a weakness to a strength as inexperienced players have grown up together. Four seniors -- left tackle Chris McGee, left guard Matt Traina, center Joe Traina (Matt's twin brother), and right guard Donald Madlock -- have combined for 120 career starts. Junior Derek Rogers is the right tackle. Scelfo said the tight ends might be the best group he has had. Three-year starter Bobby Hoover returns along with junior Jerome Landry, who started in 2003 when Hoover was injured but missed last season with an injury. The defensive line might be Scelfo's deepest, featuring a rare combination of youth and experience. Eight players have started, though none is a senior. Junior tackles Taurean Brown, Taylor Bertin and Michael Purcell are the most experienced linemen. Redshirt freshman Alvin Johnson, sophomore Frank Morton and junior Tremell Jack will also play. Sophomore Antonio Harris and junior Billy Harrison anchor the end positions, backed up by Purcell, junior Craig Morris and redshirt freshmen Julian Shives-Sams and Reggie Scott. True freshmen Sean Carney and Matt Slocum could see time. The Green Wave has probably the best starting trio of linebackers under Scelfo, but questionable depth. The starters are also seniors Anthony Cannon (middle), Antonio Mason (strong) and Brandon Spincer (weak). Cannon is on pace to become Tulane's all-time leading tackler. Tulane must replace its second-leading tackler from last season -- strong safety Joey Dawson, who ran out of eligibility. He's replaced by sophomore Joe Goosby. The secondary gets back Tra Boger, a starter in 2003 who was injured last season and will start at free safety. The Green Wave has four experienced cornerbacks, including senior Sean Lucas, a three-year starter, and juniors Israel Route and Jeremy Foreman. "A big key in the secondary is going to be how physical our corners can play," Scelfo said. "I thought we took a step back last year. We've got to do a better job of playing the ball in the air on the back end and create more turnovers." The Green Wave caused just 13 turnovers, including six interceptions, last season. The return game is in good hands with Smith and Boudreaux on kickoffs and Route on punts. Junior Chris Beckman was a first-team all-Conference USA pick last season after averaging 42.7 yards per punt. The place-kicking position is shaky. Junior Barrett Pepper is expected to handle all duties even though he handled only kickoffs last season after making 3-of-7 field goals as a freshman in 2003. Last season, Tulane made just 4-of-10 field goals.

227	 Main Index Colleges Preps Pros Louisiana Tech hopes to reclaim glory By WILLIAM WEATHERS wweathers@theadvocate.com Advocate sportswriter Jack Bicknell Louisiana Tech football coach Jack Bicknell realizes the grievous mistake he made six years ago. "You want to struggle about three years and right when they start really getting aggravated, you win the league," said Bicknell, tongue firmly planted in cheek. "You get a five-year contract and then you go from there. Like an idiot, I win in the first year." He did it again two years later, guiding Louisiana Tech to a Western Athletic Conference championship and Humanitarian Bowl appearance. Since then the Bulldogs suffered back-to-back losing seasons and went into a late-season tailspin in 2004, needing a 51-14 victory over Rice to avoid a similar fate and finish 6-6. Bicknell has won more games (33) than all but three coaches in school history. But even with a contract that expires at the end of next year he doesn't appear daunted by the task of trying to recapture the enthusiasm that marked his earlier years. "I never look at it as pressure," said Bicknell, whose team is picked to finish fourth in the WAC this year. "Football is not pressure, but it's also not an easy situation. We do play a tough schedule, but we'll give it everything we have. If it's not enough, then I won't be here next year." STATE PREVIEWS La. College | La. Tech La.-Lafayette | La.-Monroe McNeese St. | Nicholls St. NW State | SE La. | Tulane Change is the operative phrase when it comes to two areas of Louisiana Tech's program this season. Bicknell welcomes five new assistant coaches -- three on offense and two on defense -- and promoted former assistant Randy Bates to defensive coordinator to replace Tim Rose, whose unit ranked 92nd in scoring defense (31.83) and 84th in total defense (407.8). "We're subtly changing schemes," Bicknell said of his defense. "We're still 3-4. I'm very excited about our defensive staff. Randy Bates has been with me the entire time and I really feel like he's ready to take over." The other visible difference for Louisiana Tech this season will be the void left by running back Ryan Moats. Moats, who registered two of the school's top three single-season rushing totals, was voted the WAC's offensive player of the year after gaining 1,774 yards and 18 touchdowns. He declared early for the NFL Draft and was a third round selection by the Philadelphia Eagles. "Every year, you just never know," Bicknell said. "It's like the great unknown. Obviously Ryan was an answer last year. We utilized him quite a bit. We're not just going to be able to rely on giving him the ball although I feel as though we have to excellent running backs. Every year it's how do these guys come through." The productivity of Moats over the past two seasons, more than 3,000 yards rushing, effectively changed the identity of Louisiana Tech's offense from the air to the ground. For Bicknell, the challenge now becomes shifting the focal point of the Bulldogs offense from solely the backfield to a more shared responsibility. That begins with quarterbacks Matt Kubik, who completed 123 of 242 passes for 1,818 yards and 10 TDs last season, Donald Allen (27 of 52 for 317 yards, 1 TD) and Zac Champion. "I hate that but that's where we're at," said Bicknell, who intends on asking Kubik and Allen to run the ball more. "We'll have to go through fall camp and I would love to have one guy emerge as the man. If they don't, that's fine also and we'll play them both." The heir apparent to Moats' position is a couple of sophomores in Freddie Franklin and Mark Dillard, a Glen Oaks graduate. Franklin rushed for 204 yards in 11 games last season. True freshmen Patrick Jackson and Weldon Brown are also expected to contend for playing time. "Everyone's got to kind of pick up the slack without having Ryan," Bicknell said. "To be honest we got too one-dimensional with Ryan. I don't think it was stupid because it worked. You want to be a team that's balanced and hopefully our quarterbacks, with a year under their belts, will be able to take more on their shoulders, receivers have to come through and of course the two running backs." The potential for another potent ground game does exist with the return of four of five offensive linemen. Louisiana Tech is led by preseason All-WAC tackle Aaron Lips of Independence, who has started in 36 straight games, and senior center Marcus Stewart of Denham Springs, a starter in his last 21 consecutive games. Tight end Aaron James of Istrouma is expected to be fully recovered from knee surgery to start his senior season. "They're both great leaders," Bicknell said of Lips and Stewart. "It's great to have them back. I feel very comfortable with our top five guys." Despite losing eight starters from last season Bicknell is also at ease with a defensive unit that returns what he calls the best linebacker corps during his tenure. Senior Byron Santiago, a preseason All-WAC selection, led the Bulldogs a year ago with 82 tackles, including 7 1/2 sacks. He'll team with Jeremy Hamilton and Barry Robertson to form the Bulldogs' standout group. Tara High graduate Quarvay Winbush is expected to start at defensive end, while former Denham Springs standout Josh Muse is a reserve nose guard behind Ladarius Love. Bicknell's greatest concern, though, is with his secondary that returns only one of four starters, led by cornerback Tramon Williams. "It's so hard to predict," Bicknell said. "A lot of times it comes down to close games and making plays in those critical situations. I think we're going to be competitive. I think we can beat any team on our schedule and any team can beat us. If we can stay healthy and make those big plays at the right time then I think we can be a pretty dangerous team."

228	 Main Index Colleges Preps Pros Zachary native Huggins gets rave reviews at SLU By GEORGE MORRIS gmorris@theadvocate.com Advocate staff writer Photo from SLU Sports Information SLU wide receiver Felton Huggins leaps into the air for a catch in the end zone last season. And to think: When Felton Huggins enrolled at Southeastern Louisiana University, he wasn't even planning to play football. Had to be coaxed -- begged, almost -- by those who knew him. Now, he's glad they did. Lions fans certainly agree. In two seasons, the Zachary native has rewritten SLU's receiving records. He already is the school's career leader in touchdown receptions (18) and second in receiving yards (1,830) and receptions (116). At 6 feet 3 inches tall and with good leaping ability, Huggins is an obvious target. He has the speed to get deep, runs good routes and catches what's thrown his way. But there was no way to know that when he arrived. At Northeast High School, Huggins was a quarterback, receiver and defensive back, passing for more than 800 yards and 10 touchdowns and making 32 tackles and five interceptions as a senior. He signed with Grambling and was redshirted his first season. Huggins wasn't happy there, partly because the school's accreditation was in jeopardy at the time. He transferred to SLU, where the football program was being revived after 17 idle seasons. But he wasn't interested, concentrating on school and trying out for the track team, a sport where he excelled in high school. Two other Grambling transfers, Jeffrey Howard and Jonathan Thomas, would have none of that. "They used to ask me every day, 'Come try out, you can play,'" Huggins said. "I used to tell them no." In the spring of 2003, he relented, and his 40-yard dash times impressed coach Hal Mumme, who offered an immediate roster spot. STATE PREVIEWS La. College | La. Tech La.-Lafayette | La.-Monroe McNeese St. | Nicholls St. NW State | SE La. | Tulane "He asked, 'Where did you play at Grambling?' I said safety. He said, 'You're a receiver, now,'" Huggins said. It took awhile to adjust. He had four catches in his first six games but ended the season with 32 catches for 517 yards and five touchdowns, and his 16.2 yards-per-catch average led the team. That late-season burst got Huggins thinking about what he could do with a full season of being comfortable in the offense. "One day I was doodling in class, and my goals for the season were to catch maybe 50 balls and nine touchdowns, score more than I did the last year," he said. Huggins underestimated himself. As a junior, he set SLU single-season records with 84 catches for 1,313 yards and 13 touchdowns, finishing third in the nation in receptions per game (7.64) and receiving yards (119.36) per game and fourth in receptions and touchdown catches. He earned third-team Associated Press All-America honors. With Mumme leaving for New Mexico State and quarterback Martin Hankins' transfer to the University of Memphis, Huggins is the top offensive returnee. "There's no question Felton has emerged into an experienced, confident receiver," said new SLU coach Dennis Roland. "I know the defenses are going to have to respect him, and it's going to be interesting to see if they're going to try to single-cover him or double-cover him. "Certainly, if they double-cover him it's going to create some opportunities for other people. We've got other good receivers, so it may not always be easy for them to do that." Huggins was has been named to the first team preseason All-Southland team and was also named a member of Consensus Draft Services, first-team "All-Underappreciated" team. That team is put together in order to honor NCAA football players, regardless of division level, whose play on the field exceeds the level of recognition the player has received nationally to date, and/or whose pro potential exceeds the common expectations currently abroad in the nation with regard to that player. If Huggins is a known quantity, it's just the opposite for quarterback Trey Willie. The senior from Loranger completed 19 of 25 passes for 173 yards and three touchdowns last year and was not intercepted, mostly in mop-up duty. In 2003, he played tight end and special teams. In high school, Willie passed for more than 4,000 yards and 44 touchdowns. Roland hopes his all-round athleticism adds to a passing game that exclusively relied on Hankins' pocket passing. "He's going to give us a little more dimension in that defenses can't drop eight or nine people off," Roland said. "In the past, maybe we sat back there in the pocket. ? Now, people are going to have to respect the fact that he can run and be a dangerous threat, which, hopefully, will open up even more of our receivers like Felton." There is a lot of experience in that receiver corps, including senior Jeffrey Howard (44 catches, 526 yards, 6 TDs in 2004), senior Hutch Gonzales (48 catches, 477 yards, 4 TDs) and junior Robby Scates (22 catches, 228 yards, 1 TD) at wideout and senior tight end Josh Taylor (32 catches, 560 yards, 3 TDs). The top candidate to replace running back Ray Perkins (1,148 yards) is Jerald Watson, a 5-foot-9, 220-pound sophomore from Morgan City who transferred from Auburn. He rushed for 6,100 yards and 62 touchdowns in four prep seasons. Junior center Donald Usry (6-3, 310) and senior right tackle Calvin Greenwood (6-6, 342) are returning offensive line starters. On defense, the Lions will switch from a 3-4 set to a 4-3 that Roland promises to be a "more aggressive, attacking style." SLU will have eight starters from 2003 or 2004 back, although the scheme change means some will be in different positions: senior Derrick Mincey (6-1, 314), junior Jay Skidmore (6-2, 256) and junior Rudy Johnson (6-2, 237) up front, senior Damien Huren (6-1, 217) and junior Ernest Wilkes (5-11, 244) at linebacker and junior Duke Adams (5-10, 192), senior Charles Hall (6-1, 192) and junior Romaliz Mayo (5-11, 176) in the secondary. Junior Jim Hall, who averaged 40.2 yards per punt and was good on 18 of 24 field goal attempts over two seasons, handles the kicking duties.

229	 Main Index Colleges Preps Pros McNeese tries to rebound from rare losing season By CARL DUBOIS cdubois@theadvocate.com Advocate sportswriter McNeese State defensive tackle Robert Hooker LAKE CHARLES -- The top line on the front of the T-shirt is, in reality, the bottom line at McNeese State: Get Back the Swagger. At an early-August practice, a football manager walked the sidelines with the message across his chest. Below it was another strong statement about some of the goals the Cowboys will bring into this season: Payback Tour 2005. The back of the shirt listed the itinerary -- the game-by-game schedule -- under the heading: Payback Tour Dates. McNeese coaches said they don't know the origin of the T-shirt, but nobody asked the manager to remove it. When you are coming off a 4-7 season, the second losing season in the program's last 14 years, little reminders have their place. After three consecutive Southland Conference championships, a stretch in which the Cowboys didn't lose a conference game, McNeese plummeted to its worst record since 1996, when a 3-8 season fell between a trip to the Division I-AA semifinals and the I-AA national championship game. "It was one of those years when you couldn't put your finger on it," sixth-year coach Tommy Tate said of the 2004 season. "There were a lot of factors involved, and it just became a snowball effect."

In his first year coaching with the Cowboys, 1979, they did not lose a regular-season game. His 1997 secondary helped McNeese lead the nation in pass defense, and from 2001-03 he led the Cowboys to their unprecedented conference 3-peat. Tate is the only coach remaining from the coaching staff that spent the bulk of the 1990s at McNeese. After losing one link to the glory days, when Guidry left for Carencro, Tate found another link eager to return to his roots -- former defensive back Delphfrine Lee, who spent two seasons with the New York Jets and will help Tate with the secondary. Lee formerly coached at McKinley High School.

To dig themselves out of the big one they created for themselves last season, the Cowboys need to have some success early in the season.

Tate, running the show and calling the defenses, will be a busy man as he tries to return the Cowboys to their winning ways. If he succeeds, the swagger will take care of itself. Cowboys want to be feared again McNeese tries to rebound from rare losing campaign By CARL DUBOIS Advocate sportswriter LAKE CHARLES -- The top line on the front of the T-shirt is, in reality, the bottom line at McNeese State: Get Back the Swagger. At an early-August practice, a football manager walked the sidelines with the message across his chest. Below it was another strong statement about some of the goals the Cowboys will bring into this season: Payback Tour 2005. The back of the shirt listed the itinerary -- the game-by-game schedule -- under the heading: Payback Tour Dates. McNeese coaches said they don't know the origin of the T-shirt, but nobody asked the manager to remove it. When you are coming off a 4-7 season, the second losing season in the program's last 14 years, little reminders have their place. After three consecutive Southland Conference championships, a stretch in which the Cowboys didn't lose a conference game, McNeese plummeted to its worst record since 1996, when a 3-8 season fell between a trip to the Division I-AA semifinals and the I-AA national championship game. "It was one of those years when you couldn't put your finger on it," sixth-year coach Tommy Tate said of the 2004 season. "There were a lot of factors involved, and it just became a snowball effect." The Cowboys began the season with injuries in the backfield. They moved players around to fill needs. They popped Southern 35-18 in the season opener, and then the bottom fell out. Southeastern Louisiana's 51-17 blowout of McNeese in the second game was a sign of things to come: The Cowboys went on to turn the ball over a record 44 times, and they surrendered 423 points, by far the worst defensive effort in school history.

230	 Main Index Colleges Preps Pros NW State motivated for title run By RANDY ROSETTA rrosetta@theadvocate.com Advocate sportswriter Photo provided by Northwestern State University Former Redemptorist standout Shelton Sampson returns to help lead an offense that averaged more than 400 yards per game last season. One of the most vivid memories Northwestern State coach Scott Stoker has of the 2004 season is a somber team meeting after the Demons' season abruptly ended. "That was probably the quietest end-of-year team gathering I've been a part of since I've been a coach or a player," said the 37-year-old Stoker, who enters his fourth season as Northwestern's head coach and 15th year as a college coach. "As a team we didn't feel good about how the season ended. The kids held on to that feeling and have used it as motivation." That feeling was a mixture of confusion and pain after Northwestern's 2004 playoff run began and ended in Montana with a sock-in-the-gut 56-7 loss. "It's a game that's hard for us to forget," Stoker said. "To go up there and basically lay an egg and play our worst game of the year at a time when we were playing our best. ... it still doesn't make any sense to me." The leftover motivation lent itself to a quick and to-the-point motto for the 2005 season: Finish it. That's where the Demons' 2005 quest begins, and if pre-season expectations mean anything, Northwestern will get a shot at redemption. With 14 starters back in the fold from last year's 8-4 Southland Conference co-champion team, Northwestern was picked by both league coaches and media relations members to win another SLC crown this season. National voters are paying attention as well. In a preseason national poll by Sports Network, the Demons were slotted No. 11. STATE PREVIEWS La. College | La. Tech La.-Lafayette | La.-Monroe McNeese St. | Nicholls St. NW State | SE La. | Tulane "Everybody in our league is picking us No. 1 and a lot of people around the country think we're pretty good, too, so we want to do everything we can to live up to all that," Northwestern tailback and former Redemptorist standout Shelton Sampson said. "We know we've got a good team and we like being the top dog. We want that bull's-eye on us." It helps to be a target when you have a well-stocked stingy defense and a veteran quarterback, and Northwestern launches the season with both. The Demons' defense ranked second nationally in two key defensive categories a year ago, allowing only 94 rushing yards and 275 total yards a game. Northwestern has to adjust to the loss of All-American middle linebacker Jamall Johnson, who led the team with 98 tackles. But the bulk of the Demons' multiple five-defensive back package returns. Leading the way are linebacker Paul Mefford (97 tackles), who slides into Johnson's vacated spot; safeties Bruce Woods from Woodlawn (94 tackles, three interceptions, six forced fumbles) and Russel Washington (93 tackles, four interceptions, 12 pass breakups); and defensive end Ed Queen (59 tackles, 7? sacks), a former star at East Ascension. Other starters back are cornerback David Pittman and d-linemen Tory Collins, Lorenzo Davis, Carlos Stephens and Chris Brown. "We had a great year on defense last year, so it might be hard to get much better," Woods said. "What made us so good last year was our aggressiveness getting to the ball and making plays when we got there. We have that same kind of attitude this year." Added Stoker, "We have a lot of guys back on a defense that was one of the best in the country, and if they play like they did last year we'll have a chance to be in every game." Likewise, the Demons' offense figures to give them a chance to compete. Northwestern churned out 408.8 yards per game last season, with 2,981 rushing yards providing the foundation. Six skill-position players are back who have started at one time or another, headed up by quarterback Davon Vinson and his top two receivers from last season, Derrick Doyle (40 catches, 631 yards, six touchdowns) and Toby Zeigler (18-399-3). Sampson split time and carries at tailback with Derrick Johnese last season and finished with 678 yards and a team-high 11 TDs. Vinson's ongoing evolution will be a major key for the Demons. He emerged late last season as one of the top QBs in the Southland, piling up nearly 700 yards of offense in victories over Texas State, Sam Houston State and Stephen F. Austin. Triggered by Vinson's late-season growth spurt, Northwestern's offense averaged 519 total yards in those three games -- all victories that helped secure the Southland title. "I don't think Davon has reached his peak yet," Stoker said. "The last three games last year I think he showed what he's capable of and he was one of the main reasons we were able to win the conference. He's a great athlete, and if he plays like that, we'll be in the middle of every game." The main area of concern for the Demons' offense is up front where senior right tackle Brian Booth of Parkview Baptist is the only returning starter. Juniors Quentin Jackson (left tackle), Kyle Dunkelberger (left guard) and Mark Rabalais (center) all got snaps last season and should be set to step in. At right guard, freshmen Charles McDaniel and Mark Coons are battling for the starting job. "We've got to find five guys who fit well together and can go out and stay healthy and grow together as a unit," Stoker said. "We're moving some guys around to see who fits best where, but that is an area of concern for us. We have a lot of guys who can do the job, but they just don't have a lot of experience yet." Northwestern's young offensive linemen won't have a chance to ease into their new jobs. Before the Demons can think about their "Finish it" mantra, they'll have to navigate a rugged start. Northwestern sandwiches road games at in-state Division I-A foes the University of Louisiana at Monroe and UL-Lafayette around a home game against perennial I-AA power North Dakota State. "We don't have a lot of time to sit around and gain experience -- we have to grow up on the run," Stoker said. "We have to come out of the chute playing well." Regardless of if that happens, the Demons will enter the SLC race as the heavy favorite. But that doesn't seem to be enough, not this year. "Last year we won the conference and had a good year, but we want a lot more than that now," Woods said. "Now we're focused on finishing every play and every practice because that's the only way we're going to end up where we want to be. "This is the year we think we can be a contender for a national championship because we have a great defense and a great quarterback," Woods said. "We have the tools and now it's just a matter of going out and doing it."

231	 Main Index Colleges Preps Pros North Texas still team to beat in SBC By WILLIAM WEATHERS wweathers@theadvocate.com Advocate sportswriter For the past four years North Texas has been the model for other Sun Belt Conference schools to emulate. They've given the rest of the league plenty to be envious of. During that time the Mean Green have: Won four straight Sun Belt championships; Established the nation's second-longest conference winning streak of 25 games; Advanced to four New Orleans Bowls, defeating Cincinnati in the 2002 event. "Right now, for everybody, it boils down with the North Texas game," Troy coach Larry Blakeney said. "Everybody that plays them it's a week in and week out battle. You've got to bring your 'A' game whether it's home or away." This year is expected to be more of the same for the Sun Belt when it comes to crowning a champion. North Texas, which opens its season Sept. 3 at LSU, garnered top billing once again from the league's coaches who installed the Mean Green as the odds-on favorite for their fifth consecutive title and New Orleans Bowl berth. STATE PREVIEWS La. College | La. Tech La.-Lafayette | La.-Monroe McNeese St. | Nicholls St. NW State | SE La. | Tulane "We have so many new players, that's what keeps us hungry," said North Texas coach Darrell Dickey, a former LSU assistant under Curley Hallman. "Those guys want to be a part of what they've seen the other guys do. They've also been told by us, and by the older players, what it takes to actually do that and we've been very fortunate." Blakeney, whose team was selected as the league runner-up to North Texas, said the mantra in the Mean Green's success is obvious. "They play great defense and they run the football and they kick it well," Blakeney said. "They don't beat themselves on offense and they don't give you a chance to have a short field." North Texas, which hosts Troy on Oct. 4 in a potential showdown game, returns five starters on offense and four on defense. The biggest source of strength for North Texas is the backfield with the return of sophomore Jamario Thomas and senior Patrick Cobbs, the league's preseason co-offensive player of the year. The duo of Thomas and Cobbs gives mid-major North Texas the distinction of returning the nation's leading rushers for the past two seasons. When Cobbs -- who rushed 307 times for 1,680 yards and 19 touchdowns in 2003 -- went down with an injury last year, Thomas became the next dominant rusher in North Texas' attack. He went on to earn conference player of the year honors with a nation's best 1,801 yards and 17 TDs. Thomas set a NCAA freshman record with five 200-yard games and was the only back in the country to rush for 200 yards or more six times. "We've got two good running backs," Dickey said. "Instead of them having to carry the entire load we'll probably split the load up and play them together some." Dickey found his biggest personnel obstacle in the summer when projected starting quarterback Joey Byerly, who played 11 games behind starter Scott Hall, was ruled academically ineligible along with four other players. Byerly could return to the team at a later date, Dickey said. "At quarterback, we're going to be playing a guy that's never taken a snap in a college game," said Dickey, noting redshirt freshman Daniel Meager was in a close battle with Byerly in the spring before being sidelined with an injury. "Hopefully by having some experience around him that can taken a little of the load off of him as he gets his feet wet and becomes more comfortable." Troy, which lost the conference's highest drafted player in first-round pick Demarcus Ware to Dallas, is bolstered by the return of preseason defensive player of the year, linebacker Bernardo Davis. The Trojans also feature preseason All-Sun Belt selections Jeff Littlejohn at defensive tackle and Johnny Faulk in the secondary. "We're all chasing North Texas right now," Blakeney said. "It's a matter of time and someone's going to catch them. I don't know if we're going to be good enough to do it this year." Middle Tennessee leads a pack of other teams, along with the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, University of Louisiana at Monroe and Arkansas State that will continue their pursuit of North Texas. The Blue Raiders have the league's top pass-catch combination in quarterback Clint Marks (2,749 yards, 14 TDs) and wide receiver Chris Henry (60-586) returning along with leading returning tackler weakside linebacker Marcel Horne (66 tackles). "When I look at the league I think it's going to be a close, hard-fought race," Blakeney said. "I think anybody in this league can beat anybody, but right now North Texas has got the whip hand on this league."

232	 Main Index Colleges Preps Pros Nicholls handles adversity, now looking for wins By RANDY ROSETTA rrosetta@theadvocate.com Advocate sportswriter Cliche' or not, just about every football coach opens a new season wondering how his team will respond to adversity. Nicholls State coach Jay Thomas can mark that question off his list before the Colonels ever take the field this year. A year ago, Thomas and Nicholls got all the adversity they wanted 11 days before the season started when head coach Daryl Daye was fired in the midst of an investigation into academic fraud. Daye wasn't implicated in the academic fraud but Nicholls officials said they fired him for "failing to maintain proper controls" over the football program. An NCAA report released in May placed Nicholls on four years probation. STATE PREVIEWS La. College | La. Tech La.-Lafayette | La.-Monroe McNeese St. | Nicholls St. NW State | SE La. | Tulane The defensive line coach at the time, Thomas ascended to his first head-coaching position in the blink of an eye and was put in charge of guiding Nicholls through a trying ordeal. "You never dream of getting your first head coaching job in circumstances like that," Thomas said. "It was tough on all of us to go through what we did last year." It also turned out to be a character-building exercise that could pay big benefits for the Colonels this season. Despite that lingering cloud last season, Nicholls put together a 5-5 season (a road game at Texas A&M-Kingsville was canceled because of Hurricane Ivan). Going into the final two weeks of the season, the Colonels were 5-3 and poised to stake a claim to the Southland Conference championship and a likely playoff berth. Back-to-back road losses at Texas State and McNeese State punctured those hopes, but the fact Nicholls was even in that position provides hope for the 2005 campaign. "The way we played last year, with everything hanging over us, definitely laid the foundation for some confidence," said Colonels defensive end Bryan Paille, a former East Ascension High School star. "We saw what we could do under adverse situations. We were able to apply what was happening off the field to game situations and we learned a lot about ourselves." Another reason for Nicholls' optimism -- 13 full-time starters are back from their on-the-job training, six on offense and seven on defense. The Colonels defense finished last season ranked second in the SLC in total defense (360.4 yards per game) and scoring defense (23.7 points per game). Six of the top seven tacklers are back from last year. Cory Vavala (team-high 69 tackles, 5? sacks in 2005) anchors the unit at middle linebacker and is expected to be flanked by veteran Levon Bailey (25 tackles) and Dustin Gisclair. The defensive line is considered a major strength, with seven seniors manning the four spots, including three of the four starters -- Michael Young and Paille at the ends and Trae Robertson in the middle. Those three combined for 99 tackles and 11? sacks last season. Chris Hester is slated at another tackle. Three starters also return in the secondary: Joe Ogletree (48 tackles) at free safety and Tommy Lee Brown (22 tackles, four sacks, five interceptions) and Henry Johnson (36 tackles, 4? sacks, four interceptions) at the corners. Chris Turner is running with the first team at strong safety. "We potentially could have a very good defense," Thomas said. "We have more maturity on that side of the ball and a lot of quality players, both starters and backups. That's where we're going to have to hang our hats early in the season." The offense won't have as many familiar faces, but can count a veteran quarterback and offensive line as major assets. Senior quarterback Yale Vannoy gives the Colonels a reliable double threat in the triple option after he passed for 700 yards and five TDs and ran for 460 and seven scores last season. He's joined in the backfield by a returning starter at fullback, Broderick Cole. In 121 attempts last season, Cole lost only 8 yards and wound up with 512 yards and four TDs. Vannoy worked on his throwing skills this summer and Thomas hinted Nicholls could put the ball in the air a little more often. But the defensive-minded Colonels coach isn't ready to go full-throttle yet. "We've had a lot of success running the option and that's going to continue to be our philosophy," Thomas said. "But we have experimented with some things that we feel Yale can do well. "We want to control the clock as much as possible, but we'd also like to be able to open things up a little bit and have the capability to throw the ball when we get the box loaded up on us. We have to show we can spread the defense." Whatever method the Colonels choose to move the ball, they'll lean heavily on a veteran offensive line. Nicholls led the Southland Conference in rushing yards last year, averaging 249.3 yards. Four starters are back up front, led by three-year letterman Jake Housson and Jacob Bender, a two-year veteran. Bender will play left tackle and line up next to left guard Ben Gombossy. Cody Stogner returns at center. Housson is battling injuries right now, and will probably shift from right tackle to right guard. The lone spot to be filled is right tackle, where Jesse Frazier, Jonathan DeAvila and Davonn Dutton -- a converted defensive tackle -- are all battling for time. "Everything starts up front for us on offense," Thomas said. "Those are the guys we need to play well." If Nicholls plays well this season, some credit will deservedly be directed toward last season when the Colonels learned how good they could be under the toughest of circumstances. The only question remaining is whether Nicholls is ready to compete for an SLC championship and the program's first playoff appearance since 1996. "In our minds, everyone here knows we have something to prove," Paille said. "We were right there at the end of last season and we let things get away from us. "We know we can win because we've done that the last few years. Now it's just a matter of proving we can take it to another level, compete for a championship and get to the playoffs."

233	 Main Index Colleges Preps Pros NW State favored, but SLC title could be up for grabs By RANDY ROSETTA rrosetta@theadvocate.com Advocate sportswriter Change is in the air again in the Southland Conference football race this season. Three new coaches and another new member with scary offensive potential make sure of that. But the old guard also figures to have a say in how the conference championship shakes out. Longtime league veteran Northwestern State is the odds-on favorite to win what figures to be another competitive race, while Sam Houston State -- one of the three programs with a new coach -- still has plenty of talent left from a team that advanced to the national semifinals last season. McNeese State and Stephen F. Austin are motivated to erase the memories of last season's meltdowns, and Nicholls State's situation has stabilized to the point where the Colonels may be poised to finally end their eight-year journey to get back to the playoffs. STATE PREVIEWS La. College | La. Tech La.-Lafayette | La.-Monroe McNeese St. | Nicholls St. NW State | SE La. | Tulane Texas State and Southeastern Louisiana provide the Southland's two wildcards. The Bobcats return more starters (20) than any team in the league and are picked right behind Northwestern in preseason predictions. But Texas State hasn't won a Southland title since joining the league 18 years ago, is just 39-74-1 in SLC play since 1987 and has never qualified for the Division I-AA playoffs. Southeastern returns to league affiliation for the first time since restarting the football program in 2003 and figures to have defensive coordinators from San Marcos to Natchitoches losing sleep with an "Air Raid" passing game unlike anything else in the Southland. The bottom line is that the Southland should again be among the country's top I-AA leagues in the country this year, and every game should be ripe with meaning. Three teams begin the season in the Sports Network Top 25: Northwestern at No. 11, Sam Houston at No. 16 and Texas State at No. 23 "There's not a whole lot separating the teams in our league," Northwestern coach Scott Stoker said. "Every game is going to be a real battle, and that's what makes coaching in this league so great." Stoker's coaching cohorts may not feel so great when they take their shot at the Demons this season. Northwestern was 8-4 last season and tied Sam Houston for the league crown with a 4-1 mark. The core group of a defense that ranked second nationally in rushing yards (94 per game) and total yards (275 per game) is back for the Demons, along with quarterback Davon Vinson. "Great defense and a veteran quarterback are usually areas you have to have to be picked high, and it happens we have both this season," Stoker said. "I don't know if that means we should be the team to beat, but a lot of people think so. I know I like this team and I know we have a great group of kids that works extremely hard. We have a chance to do some great things if that group establishes some chemistry and stays focused." The one factor working against Northwestern is its road schedule in the SLC. The Demons play at Sam Houston (Oct. 8) and at Texas State (Oct. 22) in two games that may go a long way in determining the league title. "We have to be ready to play every time we step on the field this year," Stoker said. "We're going to be a good football team, but every team we play is going to be ready to take their best shot at us." Nicholls was the only team that had enough to top the Demons a year ago. The Colonels hammered Northwestern 40-14 last Oct. 21 and followed with a 41-23 victory over Stephen F. Austin, 41-23. But Nicholls couldn't keep that impressive run going, and lost its last two games to miss the playoffs again. One of those setbacks came against McNeese State, which struggled to a 4-7 record last season. If the Colonels hope to break though, ending a six-game losing streak to the Cowboys may be a key. The two teams meet in the season finale again this year. "We've shown we can compete against teams like Northwestern and McNeese and we think we're right there on the same level with them," said Nicholls defensive end Bryan Paille, a former star at East Ascension. "Now we have to show we can be a little more consistent and take the next step and play for the conference championship." Whether Southeastern can jump into the mix for a league title or even compete week in and week out may depend on how well opponents adjust to the Lions' passing game. Playing an independent schedule last year, SLU's offense averaged 537.1 yards a game last season, at least 65 yards more than any other team in the Southland. The Lions passed for 408 yards a contest and return a loaded cast of receivers this year. "Southeastern will be different than anybody else we play," said Nicholls coach Jay Thomas. The Colonels and Lions play this season for the first time since 1985. "We'll have to be really prepared for that style of offense." Southeastern prepared for the Southland over the last two years, playing three games each year against league foes. The Lions went just 1-5 in those games, but the victory was a noteworthy 51-17 triumph at No. 6-ranked McNeese last September. "The difference now is that we're going to be playing this people every week," SLU coach Dennis Roland said. "We've got to be at the top of our game every week."

234	 Main Index Colleges Preps Pros Armstrong confident Wildcats can challenge By JASON RUSSELL jrussell@theadvocate.com Advocate sportswriter David Armstrong The carousel of coaches continued in 2005 for Louisiana College, but the Wildcats are looking to continue a more positive trend -- improvement. LC, which revived football for the 2000 season, has either improved or equaled its win total every year from the previous year, culminating with a 5-5 season in 2004. With their third head coach in two years, continuing that trend might prove to be difficult, but not impossible, according to new coach David Armstrong. "The big thing is getting to know the kids and them getting to know you," said Armstrong, who replaced Norman Joseph, now head coach at American Southwest Conference rival Mississippi College. "But they have responded like champions. I feel very blessed to have this group of guys here at Louisiana College." Perhaps the biggest reason for Armstrong to be optimistic is the return of senior quarterback Wes Cooper, who started last year after replacing Jamie Rister as the starter in 2003. Cooper threw for 2,874 yards and 28 touchdowns in 2004 and Armstrong said he is the key to any success LC will have this season. "Wes is one of the most competitive men I've ever been around," Armstrong said. "He knows the game inside and out. "He is a very talented quarterback and understands defenses. I expect him to be the best quarterback in our conference this year and he will be if we go out and execute every game." STATE PREVIEWS La. College | La. Tech La.-Lafayette | La.-Monroe McNeese St. | Nicholls St. NW State | SE La. | Tulane Being the best in the conference could prove to be a daunting task with the likes of Hardin Simmons and Mary Hardin-Baylor, perennial national contenders in Division III, at the top of the list in ASC. While LC finished 4-5 in conference play last season, the toughness of the league doesn't seem to bother Armstrong. "It's a really good conference. I call it the SEC of Division III football," he said. "Week in and week out you are going to be playing excellent competition but as a coach I wouldn't want it any other way. "You want to play the best and to be honest, I don't care what these other schools do -- I am worried about Louisiana College. I worry about us being the best we can be. Yes, we're going to play good teams. If we are the best we can be, we'll go out every week and we'll do fine." Armstrong said the steady improvement of the Wildcats, including last year's good year, have instilled confidence in the players. "I think last year the kids started believing they could compete with anybody," Armstrong said. "That's the thing I noticed on this team. We've got the guys right now, we can win a bunch of games. Last year was a big stepping stone and we want to take it one more step." Of course playing in Division III, where there are no athletic scholarships, presents its own challenges -- mainly getting players to play without promising academic scholarships, which is against NCAA rules. "The challenges are putting financial aid packages together to make it feasible for them to come here," Armstrong said. "We go after kids that have a 20 on the ACT and a 3.0 grade point average or better because we know those kids are going to get TOPS money and we'll match that. "It's a long and lengthy process. but we can still get some really good football players." LC opens its season on the road at Rhodes College and then embarks on a nine-game conference schedule.

235	 Main Index Colleges Preps Pros Saints have sunny outlook for season By SHELDON MICKLES smickles@theadvocate.com Advocate sportswriter Associated Press photo Saints running back Deuce McAllister rushed for 1,074 yards last year. METAIRIE -- Even though it's been 233 days since the New Orleans Saints played a game that counted, there's hardly a player on that team who doesn't remember the roller coaster of emotions that afternoon. In less than an hour, the Saints experienced the high of ending the regular season with a four-game winning streak and the low of being denied a spot in the playoffs when the St. Louis Rams kicked a field goal in overtime to beat the New York Jets and win a tiebreaker over the Saints. Just like that, they were left out of postseason play for a fourth straight season -- a fact that wasn't lost on four-time Pro Bowl wide receiver Joe Horn. There wasn't much they could do when their fantastic finish (4-0) was canceled out by a stumbling start (4-8). "The guys really were hungry, but they were also sad because we waited so late to do it," Horn said. "But it happened. It's a new year now and guys feel the same way we felt when we left the locker room at Carolina last year." Yes, it's a new year. But many of the same questions that haunted the Saints most of last season are still hanging around Jim Haslett's team as they prepare to try and end their playoff drought. Quarterback play and a defense that ranked last in the NFL in total yards allowed last season will be the focal points if the Saints expect to show some improvement when the regular season begins on Sept. 11 with a return trip to the place where it ended on Jan. 2 -- at Carolina. They hope the optimism they ended the season with will carry over to Haslett's sixth season, which comes after he survived some rocky times to retain his job. He and his players are also hopeful that an extremely smooth and quiet offseason, for one of the few times since their last playoff trip in 2000, is a sign of things to come. "I don't think a circus-like atmosphere is real positive for your football team," Haslett said at the outset of training camp last month. "I think a business-like attitude is much better." PRO FOOTBALL Saints have sunny outlook for season Saints' Horn not your average Joe Sheldon Mickles | NFC | AFC While he claimed it wasn't necessarily on his team's offseason agenda, Haslett said it doesn't hurt to stay away from headline-grabbing stories during the spring and summer months. "I think the big thing is those kinds of things disrupt your football team," he said. "If it doesn't disrupt your team, then it doesn't make a difference. But I thought the offseason was smooth. "We got accomplished what we tried to get accomplished," said Haslett, who is 42-38 in regular-season games since arriving in 2000. "There were no incidents. There were no problems on or off the field, and that's a positive." Saints General Manager Mickey Loomis, who helped get Horn, Deuce McAllister and Mike McKenzie signed to long-term contracts in the past three months, and had all of his team's draft picks signed and in camp for the first practice, agreed that it can only be good for the team. "Obviously, you always want to have an offseason like that," Loomis said. "You want to have positive things happen. We've tried to get the type of players that are going to have good character and are going to handle themselves in a professional way. "I'd say it's somewhat by design, but once again, things happen sometimes that are out of your control. We've been fortunate this offseason to not have anything that's been a distraction." That leaves the rest up to the players. The Saints made very few personnel changes on either side of the ball, preferring to go with continuity -- lining up on offense with only two new starters and one defense with one. The offensive focus during the offseason and in training camp was a more productive running game after the Saints finished 27th out of 32 teams last season with an average of just 100.4 yards per game. McAllister, a two-time Pro Bowl pick, rushed for 1,074 yards and became the first player in club history with three straight 1,000-yard seasons. But he was hampered by a sprained ankle that robbed him of his speed and cutting ability, and an offensive line that opened few holes. So the Saints brought in right guard Jermane Mayberry as one of their top free-agent acquisitions and used a first-round draft pick to select Outland Trophy winner Jammal Brown, who was immediately penciled in as the starter at right tackle. Another focal point was pre-snap penalties, which often put the Saints in a hole early in drives last season. Delay of game and false-start penalties were common occurrences. So new offensive coordinator Mike Sheppard cut the playbook in half and equipped quarterback Aaron Brooks with a wristband and abbreviated play chart that allows plays to be called much quicker. "We never got in a rhythm, and that's what we are trying to eliminate," Haslett said of an offense that scored 29 first-quarter points in 16 games. "We are trying to start faster and get in a rhythm. We took too many pre-snap penalties early, and it put us in a situation where we were always punting. Hopefully, what we're doing on offense will clean that up." Haslett said it has worked well so far in training camp. "We're practicing faster," he said. "We are doing some things with Aaron where he can get out of the huddle and look things over and make sure he is seeing what he's seeing and not rushing to the line of scrimmage as much. I think they like it." Brooks, for one, feels more comfortable with the simplified offense. Even though he threw for 3,000 yards and 20 touchdowns for a club-record fourth straight season, the seven-year veteran was also inconsistent at times. "I think it will give us an opportunity to go out there and play and react to things instead of thinking on the run," Brooks said. "But I have a job to do. I have to run the offense the best I can whether it's complicated or simplified. That's my job week in and week out, so I expect nothing but the best." In addition to having Brooks, McAllister and Horn back, other key returnees on offense are wide receiver Dont? Stallworth, tight end Ernie Conwell, tackle Wayne Gandy and center LeCharles Bentley. On defense, the big question is whether the Saints can stop the run. Last season, they ranked near the bottom of the league in allowing 140.8 rushing yards a game before finishing 30th. Haslett and defensive coordinator Rick Venturi are confident the Saints, who played much better against the run in the four-game winning streak to close the season, can continue to improve. "Well, obviously, these guys being together for a whole year will help," Haslett said. "I think that's the most important thing. Guys know where they fit on our line. "You have to be disciplined to stop the run," he said. "There are two ways you get beat in the run: if you're not disciplined, and if you are not physical. People can physically beat you, but not being at the right spot or not being in the right gap is the other way you get beat. Our guys have played together for a year, so I think that's going to help." The Saints know how important stopping the run is if they want to be successful. With defensive ends Darren Howard, Charles Grant and Will Smith combining for 29 sacks a year ago, they can get after quarterbacks -- but they know that run defense comes first. The young linebacking corps of James Allen, who was injured most of training camp, Courtney Watson and Colby Bockwoldt played well at the end of the 2004 season and will also have to play a key role in holding up the run. The secondary also came up big late last season when McKenzie and Fakhir Brown, the two cornerbacks, started playing more man-to-man coverages. Strong safety Jay Bellamy enjoyed another solid season and will be joined this year by free safety Dwight Smith, a free-agent signee who brings more playmaking ability to the position than Tebucky Jones. Special teams are in good hands as usual with kicker John Carney, who is still a valuable weapon at 41, Pro Bowl punter Mitch Berger and long snapper Kevin Houser. Kick returner Michael Lewis, who rebounded nicely from an injury-plagued 2003 season, is also back.

236	 Main Index Colleges Preps Pros Mickles: Steelers to show mettle with title By SHELDON MICKLES smickles@theadvocate.com Advocate sportswriter It's the next-to-last week of August, and that means NFL training camps are closing -- thankfully -- and teams are starting to zero in on the regular season, which begins a little more than two weeks from today. On the night of Sept. 8, the New England Patriots officially begin their bid for an unprecedented third straight Vince Lombardi Trophy -- and their fourth in five years -- when they host the Oakland Raiders. When they became only the eighth team to win back-to-back Super Bowls with their 24-21 win over the Philadelphia Eagles in February, the Patriots immediately began thinking about making more history. More than 6 1/2 months later, however, there are questions about the latest NFL dynasty. Lots of changes, especially on defense, suggest that the road to another title will be anything but Easy Street for the Pats. But there are lots of questions floating around the NFL these days. Some will be answered early and some late, which will bring us to a Feb. 5 showdown in Detroit's Ford Field for Super Bowl XL. Inquiring minds want to know, so here are 10 questions to ponder before the Patriots and Raiders kick off the regular season just 16 days from now: PRO FOOTBALL Saints have sunny outlook for season Saints' Horn not your average Joe Sheldon Mickles | NFC | AFC 1. Can the Patriots do it again? There's no use in wasting any time for this one. As long as Tom Brady stays healthy, they should be in the hunt. But the defense has some real issues -- a stroke that will likely keep linebacker Tedy Bruschi off the field this season, the retirement of linebacker Teddy Johnson at the start of camp and the brief holdout of defensive tackle Richard Seymour -- but you know Bill Belichick will have them playing at a high level again. 2. Which divisions will be the most competitive? There's a big difference of opinion on several divisions, mainly the AFC West and NFC North -- where bitter three-team battles are expected -- but the NFC South could be that way as well. The Atlanta Falcons and Carolina Panthers are favored, but the New Orleans Saints have the talent on offense to give both a run if they can get anything from the defense. 3. Which teams will have the biggest cakewalk in their divisions? The Indianapolis Colts in the AFC South and Philadelphia Eagles in the NFC East. The Colts win easily because of Peyton Manning despite the lack of a championship-caliber defense and the Eagles roll despite the presence of tempestuous wide receiver Terrell Owens. 4. Speaking of T.O., can he and quarterback Donovan McNabb -- or anyone else on that team -- co-exist? In a word, no. Then again, the Eagles knew what they were getting into when they traded for Owens last season and gave him a fat contract. If the Eagles get through the season without imploding at least three times, it'll be a miracle. 5. Can Manning break the record he set last season when he threw for 49 touchdowns? Why not? Manning still has his big three in Marvin Harrison and Louisiana natives Reggie Wayne and Brandon Stokley, although Stokley might get off to a slow start because of a shoulder injury, so 50 (or more) is definitely not out of the question. 6. Who will be the surprise teams in each conference? In the NFC, the Detroit Lions have been quietly putting things together going into Steve Mariucci's third season. They could win the North even though a second-place finish and wild-card playoff berth is more likely. In the tough AFC, the Jacksonville Jaguars could make a strong push for a playoff spot. 7. Which rookies will have the greatest impact on their teams? If Carnell "Cadillac" Williams can't get the Tampa Bay Bucs' anemic running game going, no one will. Wide receiver Matt Jones, the former Arkansas quarterback, has been getting rave reviews in the Jaguars' camp and running back J.J. Arrington, a second-round pick, will help the Arizona Cardinals' rushing attack. 8. How many games will Nick Saban win with the Miami Dolphins? It's going to take some time to clean up that mess and Saban will need to show patience along the way -- especially this year. But how much patience will he be able to show in winning five games? 9. Can the Saints make the playoffs? Once again, the inconsistency they have shown over the past four seasons will be the key to their season. If they can get their offense to play to the level it's capable of, which means that Deuce McAllister must have a monster year to take the pressure off Aaron Brooks, and the defense shows any improvement, they can. The guess here: nine wins and a wild-card. 10. Who'll win Super Bowl XL? Despite the dynasty talk and distractions that are sure to come from that, the Patriots have the ability to become the first team to win three in a row. But they won't because the AFC has more than a few teams that can dethrone them. Last year's expected Keystone State match between the Pittsburgh Steelers and Eagles didn't materialize, but this time it does with the Steelers winning it all for the first time in 26 years with a solid running game, steady quarterback play and a stifling defense -- clipping the Eagles, 23-19.

239	 Main Index Colleges Preps Pros Saints' Horn not your average Joe By SHELDON MICKLES smickles@theadvocate.com Advocate sportswriter File photo Joe Horn called national attention to himself for this cell phone incident two years ago. METAIRIE -- Wherever he goes, four-time Pro Bowl wide receiver Joe Horn is remembered for pulling out a cell phone that he had hidden underneath the padding of a Superdome goalpost during a nationally televised game in 2003 and trying to make a call to his children. The stunt got Horn a tongue-lashing from his coach, a stiff fine from the NFL and more cell phone jokes than he could ever imagine on national sports shows. But, as family and friends who are close to Horn already know, he should be remembered for much more than his on-field antics. What you see is not always what you get with Joe Horn. On the contrary, the flamboyant, colorful, outlandish New Orleans Saints' wide receiver is transformed into a completely different person when you get him away from the football field. What you see when the television cameras are on -- the brashness, trash-talking and carefully choreographed touchdown dances -- are strictly for showmanship and entertainment. What you don't see away from the field is his sincerity, generosity and patriotism, yes patriotism. But not getting a lot of attention for those things is the way Horn, who was born in Connecticut and spent his formative years in several North Carolina towns, wants it. Whether it's donating thousands of dollars to the football program at his high school in Fayetteville, N.C., helping out people in the community, or simply making the day a little bit brighter for a member of the military, the 10-year veteran dodges recognition the way he dodges defensive backs. PRO FOOTBALL Saints have sunny outlook for season Saints' Horn not your average Joe Sheldon Mickles | NFC | AFC Horn often visits homeless shelters, participates in and donates money to several football clinics each year, holds autograph sessions for youngsters, and talks to high schoolers about the importance of getting an education. The reason is simple. Horn, now 33, came up the hard way --fatherless and poor, living in the projects with nothing in the refrigerator but government-issued cheese, all the while watching friends die and drug deals go down. "I have a heart for people that don't have, and people that struggle and go through life situations," said Horn, who signed a new six-year, $42 million contract with the Saints in May. "That's because of where I came from and because of the struggles I've had in my life. "I've been through the worst of the worst, and I know what people go through when they have bad problems," he said. "I have a big heart for that, but I like to keep it between me and that person." That may be hard for some to believe the way Horn, who has 438 catches, 6,289 receiving yards and 45 TDs in only five seasons with the Saints, carries himself on the field. Known around the league for his gyrations after big plays, dancing in the end zone and pulling a cell phone from the goalpost padding following a scoring catch in 2003, the perception is Horn is anything but humble. But, his friends say, those people don't know the real Joe Horn. As a football standout at Douglas Byrd High School in 1988 and '89, Horn was mischievous and fun-loving, traits he obviously carries to this day. "Joe loves to joke around," said Bob Paroli, who coached Horn in high school and remains extremely close to his former star quarterback and tailback. "He loves to have fun and he loves to laugh." Then again, Horn knows when to be serious. That came to the forefront in the Saints' 27-13 victory over the Dallas Cowboys in Texas Stadium last December. Horn made a sensational, leaping 31-yard touchdown catch late in the game and disdained his usual end-zone routine, instead running to a banner hanging from the stadium wall. Horn pointed to each of the words on the sign, which read "Remember Our Troops," and then hugged it. Like most of his touchdown celebrations, this one was choreographed after he spotted the sign in pregame warmups. "God makes things happen for a reason," Horn said. "We scored down in that corner and I told the fans that if we had scored in the other end zone, I would have run all the way down there because (the troops) deserved that." What was more important, he said, was that it came from the heart. "When I saw that sign, they were the first thing I thought about," he said of the U.S. troops. "I didn't think about why we had to win the game, I didn't think about the playoffs, I didn't think about none of that stuff. "That (war) is what's happening and that's what they're going through, and I thought I should let the world know," Horn added. "We're here trying to win games, then we go home and kiss our kids and have a lovely life and have a nice bank account and ride around in nice cars. Those men and women over there are sacrificing for me to sleep peacefully at night." Horn's agent, Ralph Vitolo, said it was no surprise to see Horn react that way. Vitolo said Horn grew up near Fort Bragg in North Carolina and has always admired the military and what they do all over the world. Horn also had two brothers serve in the military. Otis Horn was on the U.S. Saratoga, the first ship that went to the Persian Gulf, and Darrian Horn was also a sailor who now works for Vice President Dick Chaney. While Horn remembers the military and respects them immensely for what they do every day, he vividly remembers his struggles as a youngster trying to find his way in life. He tells of watching, when he was only 8 or 10 years old, some of his cousins counting $200,000 one day and wanting a piece of the action. Thankfully, he said, they ushered him out of the room. "I saw all of that, I've seen drug deals and I've seen lots of money passed," Horn said. "I've seen so much stuff. ... I saw people get killed." Tragically, he also saw a cousin who taught him everything he knew about football and basketball overdose on drugs. "That destroyed me in high school," Horn said. "I had opportunities to go that way, but I saw how some of my friends and family ended up. They ended up dead or behind bars." When his mother, a registered nurse who had to hold down a second job to make ends meet, moved around to get a better job or find a better place to live, she would leave the kids with an aunt or grandmother. "She was trying to find her way, too," Horn recalled. "She was young and had four, five or six kids. But when she established herself and was stable enough to take care of us after a couple of months, she'd send for us. "That's what I always respected about my mother, she never forgot about her children. She was a single parent, but she always wanted to do right." Because he didn't have the grades to play at a Division I school after graduating from high school, Horn wound up at Itawamba (Miss.) Junior College. Two years later, he still didn't have the grades and went to work to support himself. He toiled in a furniture factory, making $6 an hour spraying protective coating on the parts before assembly, and even flipped hamburgers while waiting for an opportunity to play pro ball -- first in the Canadian Football League, and eventually, the NFL. "I was doing whatever I had to do -- legally -- to have an income coming in," Horn said proudly. "I learned that as part of my upbringing. I had to survive and I had to sacrifice." That's why, when he sees a person in a military uniform shopping in a store, Horn will often go to the cashier and anonymously leave $100 to take care of their purchases. "Some people don't know who I am, especially if I'm up in Maryland or New York, but I'll do it if I see someone in uniform," he said. "He may never have gotten on a plane to go to war, but they're still under the government issue to go to war." Handing out $100 bills to children walking down a road in rural Mississippi or to the waitress that served him in a restaurant is also a common practice for Horn. "The lady that served us could have some bill problems at home, or she may be working three jobs," he said. "I'm not doing it to brag or because I'm Joe Horn. She might be able to use that to pay a $63 water bill, so it's a blessing to me." Vitolo, who has known Horn since Horn's high school days, and Paroli have seen many other acts of kindness -- including some that hit close to home. A few years ago, Vitolo's father died and Horn insisted on being at the funeral even though the Saints were having a mandatory minicamp. Because he doesn't like to fly, Horn began driving to North Carolina until realizing he couldn't get there, attend the services and get back to New Orleans in time for practice. He sent flowers instead. "I told him not to come," Vitolo said, "but he was coming anyway. I fussed at him, and at least he listened. But that's the type of person Joe is. We have a very good personal and business relationship. "Joe is a loquacious guy and a very sincere guy," he added. "It's the same way with Coach Paroli. Joe's given Byrd High quite a bit of money. He's probably given more to them than most guys give to their college." Horn's numerous contributions over the years have allowed Paroli to buy, among other things, goalposts, jerseys and shorts, and even helped feed the players on Saturday mornings after a Friday night victory. "He does a lot of things, but the only thing most people see is what he does on Sundays -- and they think that's what he's all about," said Paroli. "Joe is much more of a person than what most people perceive him to be because of the cell phone incident. "The best thing is he hasn't forgotten where he came from. He comes home and sits down with the kids in the community and tells them how his life has gone and how the Lord blessed him, and what they can do to be successful, too. He gives great talks to young people simply because he used to sit where they're sitting."

240	 Main Index Colleges Preps Pros Outfitting, supporting teams brings high cost By ROBIN FAMBROUGH Advocate sportswriter Mark Saltz Outfitting players (Darrell Glasper II of Redemptorist shown here) is a costly endeavor for high schools. Game jersey -- $25 to $75. Shoulder pads -- $60 to $350. Game balls -- $50 each. Stencil to paint yard markers -- $320 to $450. Stadium rental -- $495. Stadium security -- up to $2,500. Cost for the high school football experience -- it's definitely not priceless. Fans attending high school football games often view those teams and their games as being the less-expensive alternative to college and pro teams. What they really see is a product that still costs thousands of dollars. "Schools can spend money in a lot of different ways," sales representative Scott Nielson of Baton Rouge's Red Stick Sports said. "Most schools buy equipment in cycles. One year they'll buy jerseys or pants. The next they'll replace 30 helmets or buy some shoulder pads. "A school starting out or buying all new equipment would probably have to budget $450 to $600 per player. It's not cheap." Two local teams, Scotlandville and St. Michael the Archangel, have larger budget burdens than normal in 2005. Scotlandville opted to go back to the school's traditional pre-magnet era colors of black and gold. HIGH SCHOOLS Previews: 2-5A | 3-5A | 4-5A | 5-5A/6-5A Previews: 5-4A | 6-4A | 7-4A Previews: 5-3A | 6-3A | 8-3A | 9-3A | 10-3A Previews: 6-2A/7-2A | 8-2A | 9-2A | 10-2A Previews: 6-1A | 8-1A | 9-1A Capsules: 2-5A | 3-5A | 4-5A | 5-5A | 6-5A Capsules: 5-4A | 6-4A | 7-4A Capsules: 5-3A | 6-3A | 7-3A| 8-3A | 9-3A Capsules: 6-2A | 7-2A | 8-2A | 9-2A | 10-2A Capsules: 6-1A | 7-1A | 8-1A | 9-1A Fambrough: New classes shuffle landscape Trio heads talented recruiting crop Outfitting teams brings high cost The Scotlandville Alumni Association has raised funds to cover the cost of new home and away uniforms, along with practice clothes. The final price tag -- somewhere between $45,000 and $50,000. St. Michael, previously known as Bishop Sullivan, had to replace a significant amount of equipment because of the school's name change for 2005-06. St. Michael coach Tut Musemeche said it cost between $300 and $500 per player to provide replacement gear. Musemeche said the Baton Rouge diocese helped defray the replacement cost. "When the name change was announced, the first thing I thought about was equipment," Musemeche said. "All most people see is the varsity team and they figure you can make up the cost with ticket sales. What they don't understand is you have to provide the same things for the freshmen and (junior varsity) teams. "So you're outfitting two or three teams and that can make a big difference. We were fortunate in that this was one of the years we were scheduled to buy one set of jerseys anyway. That helped." In order to help defray some of the costs for 2005, Musemeche said the school's ninth-grade team will wear one set of last year's varsity jerseys which say "Warriors" and an older set of jerseys that say "Sullivan." The price range for individual equipment items varies. Helmets can cost between $115 and $300 each and must be certified and reconditioned every two years under high school rules. The reconditioning cost can also run several thousand dollars, depending on how many helmets are serviced. Custom paint for helmets starts at $8 per helmet. Teams that use the popular Michigan-style helmet can pay up to $35 per helmet for paint. Decals for helmets cost $5 to $7 each. Shoulder pads cost between $60 and $350 and can also be reconditioned. Specialty items, such as the flak jackets quarterbacks and running backs use cost as much as $100 each. A pair of cleats typically costs between $45 to $60 and game pants are in the $35 (plain) to $50 (stripes) range. Other miscellaneous items, such as a T-shirts and shorts, must also be considered. Musemeche said St. Michael easily spent more than $1,000 on T-shirts, which run $6 to $7 each. Team shorts cost $10 to $12. "What we do is stagger buying jerseys, pants and helmets," Broadmoor athletic trainer and equipment manager Tim Gonda said. "You can get it to balance out fairly well. "But things do happen you can't predict. We've had game jerseys and pants only last a couple of years. By the same token, we've had practice jerseys that kids wear every day last as much as 10 years." Nielson says equipment purchases also follow trends, noting the current style is for basic game uniforms that feature little decoration. "It used to be that you'd have schools buy cheap jerseys and a spend a lot of money putting either the school name or mascots on them," Nielson said. "Now you have schools buying better jerseys that last longer and they put very little on them." The most copied style for Louisiana high schools is the striping LSU uses on its jerseys, which is called the UCLA stripe in equipment circles, according to Nielson. It's a style that is seldom sold in other parts of the nation. Of course, there is much more to the cost of high school football than just the clothes the players wear. Several local high schools do not have stadiums of their own and utilize one of two stadiums managed by the Baton Rouge Parks and Recreation Department. BREC's 5,000-seat Olympia and 20,000-seat Memorial stadiums serve as home games for Belaire, Tara, Glen Oaks, Capitol, Catholic High and St. Michael. Cost for the basic stadium rental is $495 per game. The cost of security is $1,750 at Olympia and $2,500 at Memorial. BREC gains profits from concessions, unlike school-based stadiums where the home team profits from concession sales. "We've budgeted $64,000 for 10 weeks of football," East Baton Rouge Parish Supervisor Ken Jenkins said. "That includes paying for security and the other things we have to do that people don't ever think about." Also notable is the fact it costs a minimum of $250 for a five-man officiating crew that includes one timer. Schools with a 30-second clock pay an extra timer, bringing the total to $280. Rising gasoline costs will be another factor as teams travel on diesel-fuel buses. Hiring a bus driver can cost as much as $50 an hour. EBR schools also are required to pay $2 per mile on each trip. Schools hosting games at their own stadiums also incur major costs the average person doesn't see. Dutchtown coach Benny Saia said his school pays security guards $20 per hour and hires 18 guards for each home game. The cost of maintaining a field can also be costly, even though the work is typically done by either the coaches or parents/alumni who volunteer their time. Painting just the required yard-lines and hash marks costs at least $70 a game, according to Broadmoor's Gonda. That doesn't include the cost of stencil to use as a paint-guide, which costs a minimum of $320. When other ornamentation is added, like a mascot or end zone paint, the cost grows to at least $200 a game, according to Dutchtown's Saia. Stencils for mascots can typically cost $300 or more. Gonda of Broadmoor notes schools with stadiums in East Baton Rouge do catch a break because the EBR school system pays for the cost of lights for games and water for fields. The cost of fertilizing and maintaining a field can easily cost up to $2,000 a year, according to Gonda. A basic pesticide treatment good for one year can run $200 per field. Fertilizer costs $13 a bag and the average field requires five 5-pound bags. Gonda said Broadmoor fertilizes three times per year. Player equipment, field rent or maintenance, buses/drivers for travel and security cover the basic expenses. Just when a coach thinks he has every expense covered, something else almost always comes up. St. Michael rents stadiums for its varsity games but uses a field behind the school for junior varsity and ninth-grade games. Musemeche saw yet another expense when he looked up at the scoreboard. "We were outside and I looked over at the scoreboard and it says, 'Bishop Sullivan,'" Musemeche said. "That's something else we'll have to fix."

241	 Main Index Colleges Preps Pros Fambrough: Classification rule shuffles landscape By ROBIN FAMBROUGH rfambrough@theadvocate.com Advocate sportswriter Who could blame some schools if they feel like they're living out an old cliche'. Welcome Louisiana High School Athletic Association football schools, this is the first season of the rest of your life. This is the first season that LHSAA member schools will be required to play in their enrollment-based classifications, according to new by-laws passed by principals two years ago. And in many ways, the teams and traditional power structure most fans know will be altered tremendously. The cliche', "This is the first day of the rest of your life" refers to waking up and going on the day after a life-altering event. HIGH SCHOOLS Previews: 2-5A | 3-5A | 4-5A | 5-5A/6-5A Previews: 5-4A | 6-4A | 7-4A Previews: 5-3A | 6-3A | 8-3A | 9-3A | 10-3A Previews: 6-2A/7-2A | 8-2A | 9-2A | 10-2A Previews: 6-1A | 8-1A | 9-1A Capsules: 2-5A | 3-5A | 4-5A | 5-5A | 6-5A Capsules: 5-4A | 6-4A | 7-4A Capsules: 5-3A | 6-3A | 7-3A| 8-3A | 9-3A Capsules: 6-2A | 7-2A | 8-2A | 9-2A | 10-2A Capsules: 6-1A | 7-1A | 8-1A | 9-1A Fambrough: New classes shuffle landscape Trio heads talented recruiting crop Outfitting teams brings high cost Life events may be as abrupt as an auto accident. While member schools had nearly two years to prepare for these LHSAA changes, it will be interesting to see if the reality of the new rules lives up to projections. Will the changes help LHSAA member schools find that mythical "level" playing field that public schools seek? Will they diminish the power of top private schools as some observers think it will? No one knows the answer to these or many other questions. What we do know is that the landscape of high school football will be markedly different. Now gone are the days when Evangel Christian of Shreveport would contend yearly for a Class 5A state title with the likes of West Monroe. Also gone is the stranglehold John Curtis of River Ridge has enjoyed in Class 4A for more than a decade. Evangel now finds itself in Class 1A, contending for titles with the likes of the local defending champion, The Dunham School. Kentwood, Haynesville and Oak Grove are other teams we typically think of in the LHSAA's smallest football class. There are other options to consider. The most notable one for local fans is the fact two-time Class 2A champion West St. John is back in Class 1A. The Rams will play in the Baton Rouge area-based District 9-1A along with Ascension Catholic-Donaldsonville, East Iberville-St. Gabriel, North Iberville-Rosedale, St. John-Plaquemine and White Castle. Also notable is Christian Life's move back to Class 1A. The Crusaders were a 1A power in the mid-1990s before moving to 2A. CLA will now play in the revamped District 7-1A with Dunham, Kentwood, first-year football school Northlake Christian of Covington and Southern Lab. Just as notable locally is the fact Curtis now finds itself back on the Class 2A level for the first time in 20 years. The Patriots will play in the new Class 2A district, 10-2A, which includes Donaldsonville, Riverside Academy of Reserve, St. Charles Catholic of LaPlace and St. James. Donaldsonville, St. James and St. Charles all dropped down from Class 3A, leaving their other River Parish rival, Lutcher, to play in a New Orleans-based Class 3A district. The changes brought by classification/enrollment changes and the new rules offer other key notable changes locally. The changes start at the top with Dutchtown, a fourth-year school with its first true senior class, moving to Class 5A. Tara drops down to Class 4A from 5A. Redemptorist, just two years removed from a Class 4A state title, moves back down to Class 3A. Capitol Pre-College Academy, traditionally a 4A school, now is divided into separate boys and girls schools in 3A. Plaquemine and Baker also move down to 3A from 4A. Traditional 2A power Northeast also moves into District 8-3A along with Redemptorist and Capitol. The changes also include Class 2A as Port Allen, previously a 3A school, moves into District 8-2A, a league that lost both Christian Life and Northeast. Consider Northlake Christian to be part of a new eight-team contingent set to play LHSAA varsity football for the first time. Traditionally, a Class B school, Northlake opted to add football a few years ago and has been gradually phasing in a program. Other "who-are-those-guys" 10 varsity football newcomers include Pine Prairie of 2A, Francis Gregory-New Orleans of 2A, Calvary Baptist-Shreveport of 1A, Desire Street Academy-New Orleans of 1A, Delhi Charter of 1A, Hamilton Christian-Lake Charles of 1A, Acadiana Prep of 1A, Helen Cox-Marrero of 4A, and Madison Parish of 2A. Calvary and Desire Street can already win the best "name-dropper" contest. Calvary will be coached by recent Green Bay Packers backup quarterback Doug Pederson. Former Florida Heisman trophy winner and Saints quarterback Danny Wuerffel is a co-founder and fund-raiser for Desire Street. Acadiana Prep and Hamilton Christian were Class B schools that opted to add football. Pine Prairie is another former Class B school that is actually a consolidated school, joining PPHS, Bayou Chicot and Chatangier. Madison Parish is a combination of Tallulah's two schools, McCall and Tallulah. Cox is new school and Gregory is a middle school that has grown into a high school. The new football schools can be rivaled by the number of coaching changes. The Baton Rouge area had 14 coaching changes of its own in the off season. Two coaches, Dru Nettles of Denham Springs and Ken Hilton of Baker, return to coach at their alma maters. Thanks to the tremendous number of questions surrounding the 2005 season, it is hard to predict what will happen next. One thing is certain. It will be season unlike any the schools and fans have had.

242	 Main Index Colleges Preps Pros Woods, Scott, Eugene head talented state crop By WILLIAM WEATHERS wweathers@theadvocate.com Advocate sportswriter Advocate staff photo by Travis Spradling Redemptorist' weakside linebacker Jonathan Hollins (center) is rated No. 25 nationally by Rivals.com. Three diverse players. Three different classifications. Three varying opinions. A season after East St. John High School quarterback Ryan Perrilloux was regarded as Louisiana's top prospect and among the nation's best quarterbacks, there's less certainty on the subject this year. That has evoked spirited debate and some emotion as well. Two of the candidates in the argument -- defensive tackle Al Woods of Elton and running back Charles Scott of Jonesboro- Hodge -- play in two of the state's smaller classifications, a catalyst in some discussions that point toward Destrehan's Jai Eugene as the state's most wanted man. "I think there is a lot of debate simply because defensive tackle Al Woods plays for Elton in Class 1A," said recruiting analyst Mike Scarborough of Tigerbait.com. "He is a Rivals.com five-star player and the only one in the state of Louisiana.? I think people need to be reminded that (former Southern Lab and LSU standout) Marcus Spears also played against Class 1A competition." Woods, a 6-foot-4, 330-pounder, has landed national acclaim from Reebok along with Rivals.com and Scout.com, a pair of services devoted to recruiting. "It was one of the more interesting questions to me that was difficult to resolve," said Allen Wallace, national recruiting editor of Scout.com and publisher of SuperPrep magazine. "I struggled with it. One guy's 330 pounds and the other 180. It depends on what you're looking for, but Woods is a fantastic defensive line and they're more difficult to come across." Woods, an LSU commitment, earned the nod over Scott, another LSU commitment, and Eugene as the top prospect in the state from Rivals.com because of a rare combination of size, strength (400-plus bench press) and speed (5.1 in 40-yard dash). He was also productive as a junior with 100 tackles, including 11 for behind the line of scrimmage. HIGH SCHOOLS Previews: 2-5A | 3-5A | 4-5A | 5-5A/6-5A Previews: 5-4A | 6-4A | 7-4A Previews: 5-3A | 6-3A | 8-3A | 9-3A | 10-3A Previews: 6-2A/7-2A | 8-2A | 9-2A | 10-2A Previews: 6-1A | 8-1A | 9-1A Capsules: 2-5A | 3-5A | 4-5A | 5-5A | 6-5A Capsules: 5-4A | 6-4A | 7-4A Capsules: 5-3A | 6-3A | 7-3A| 8-3A | 9-3A Capsules: 6-2A | 7-2A | 8-2A | 9-2A | 10-2A Capsules: 6-1A | 7-1A | 8-1A | 9-1A Fambrough: New classes shuffle landscape Trio heads talented recruiting crop Outfitting teams brings high cost USA Today recently named Woods as the nation's No. 15 prospect while Scout.com selected him as the country's fifth-best defensive tackle and state's third overall prospect. "He's got all of the physical abilities, but he's got the work ethic to go with it," Elton first-year coach Bret Fuselier said of Woods, the No. 2 ranked tackle by Rivals.com and 16th overall prospect. "He didn't miss a summer workout. He was here early in the morning and that's what it takes to be successful. He won't allow somebody to outwork him or be better than him." Scout.com went with Eugene, a 6-0, 185-pounder, over Woods and Scott for supremacy atop its rankings. Eugene, who is considering scholarship offers from LSU, USC, Florida, Miami, Michigan, Oklahoma and Tennessee, was named the nation's No. 1 cornerback by Scout.com and No. 23 prospect overall by USA Today. According to Rivals.com, he's rated seventh best and 92nd overall. "He's a special athlete," Destrehan coach Steve Robicheaux said. "You see him on the field and he's always working hard. He's going 100 miles per hour. He's just a great kid to be around." Although Eugene is considered the nation's top cornerback because of his speed (4.4), cover skills and athletic ability, he will play sparingly on defense in order to concentrate on quarterback. "He's a better defensive player, but he's going to start at quarterback," Robicheaux said. "He's just a great athlete that's getting better at quarterback. We just feel like having the ball in his hands every down is a plus. "What he can do in the field compares to the big names we've had here," Robicheaux said. "He could play wide receiver in college or defensive back. He's that good of a player, one of the best we've seen around here in a long time." The powerfully built Scott (6-0, 215) has garnered national attention from most recruiting services. USA Today ranked Scott as its No. 13 running back, while he was selected as the ninth-best running back and No. 79 overall prospect by Rivals.com. "We run a one-back offense so we're going to give the ball to the tailback a lot," Jonesboro Hodge coach Shannon Brown said. "He's a different type of back. He's got good speed but he's also real physical. He can bang it up the middle, get outside and still catch the ball. He's really a pleasure to have because he's the total package." Scott's summer commitment to LSU hasn't deterred all schools from recruiting him, Brown said. "USC has told him they didn't care," he said. "They want to stay after him." Scott finds himself squarely at the top of the discussion about the strength in this state's recruiting class this year. Scott, Rayville's Richard Murphy (an LSU commitment), Alexandria's Chris Brown, Holy Cross' Moncell Allen (a Kentucky commitment) and Patterson's William Griffin provide the state with a strong running back contingent that's drawn national attention from assorted recruiting services. "The strengths in the state of Louisiana will always be at skill positions," Scarborough said. "Scott and Murphy are committed to LSU, Allen to Kentucky and Brown has a scholarship offer from Arkansas with Oklahoma and Alabama?taking a strong look." The skill-position surplus fills up in a hurry when you take a look at the state's wide receiver position. East St. John has two of the top prospects in Rickey Dixon and Louis Lee, while O. Perry Walker's Kendrick Lewis has already committed to Ole Miss. John Ehret's Chris Mitchell and Kennedy's Courtney Smith are all considered national targets. While Woods is at the head of the class the defense line -- both tackles and ends -- there's an excess of quality with Ruston's Lazarius Levingston (an LSU commitment and No. 5 prospect in the state by Rivals.com) along with Hahnville's Kentrell Lockett, Destrehan's Chaz Washington, Northside's Jarrod Shaw and Redemptorist's Jonathan Hollins, ranked 25th nationally by Rivals.com among weakside defensive ends. There's also quality at linebacker with LSU commitments Jacob Cutrera of Acadiana-Scott and Troy Giddens of Hammond. Tara's Brian Duncan is also rated by Rivals.com as the state's No. 27 prospect. Along with Eugene the secondary features West Monroe's Shomari Clemons, an LSU commitment, and Jeremy McGee of New Orleans-Karr, a UCLA commitment. "I think this year's class is slightly better than last year's," Wallace said. "I think when you talked recruiting in Louisiana Ryan Perrilloux dominated the conversation. This year it's slightly above average."

243	 Main Index Colleges Preps Pros Catholic High, St. Amant top 3-5A picks By ROBIN FAMBROUGH rfambrough@theadvocate.com Advocate sportswriter Advocate staff photo by Kerry Maloney Top 3-5A players include (front row from left ) Dutchtown's Curtis Taylor, Walker's Jarrod Baker and Central's Zack Morris, (back row from left) Catholic's Julius Fleming, St. Amant's Allan Burns, Denham Springs' Ian Burks and Woodlawn's Corey Day. Like the Green Bay Packers and Chicago Bears, two teams that dominated an NFL division in the 1960s, Catholic High and St. Amant seem to share a football identity. For more than a decade, the two teams wearing black have monopolized the top spots in the Baton Rouge district for teams in Louisiana's top classification. Either the Bears and Gators have either won or shared the title in Baton Rouge's top classification district in 14 of the past 15 years. The two rivals begin a new era in 2005. Some changes are cosmetic. Others will likely be competitive. First, there's a reduced number of districts brought about by the Louisiana High School Athletic Association's latest classification plan. That makes the local league District 3-5A instead of the traditional 4-5A. There is also a change in the makeup of the seven-team district. Tara, last year's district runner-up, has moved down in class to Class 4A. Joining the league for the first time is Dutchtown, a fourth-year Ascension Parish school that previously played in 4A. Two coaching changes must also be noted. Dru Nettles, previously head coach at Woodlawn, has taken over at his alma mater, Denham Springs. Kyle Acosta, an assistant coach at River Parish power East St. John, is the new Woodlawn coach. Of course, these changes don't take into account the challenges Catholic coach Dale Weiner and St. Amant coach David Swacker see for their teams. HIGH SCHOOLS Previews: 2-5A | 3-5A | 4-5A | 5-5A/6-5A Previews: 5-4A | 6-4A | 7-4A Previews: 5-3A | 6-3A | 8-3A | 9-3A | 10-3A Previews: 6-2A/7-2A | 8-2A | 9-2A | 10-2A Previews: 6-1A | 8-1A | 9-1A Capsules: 2-5A | 3-5A | 4-5A | 5-5A | 6-5A Capsules: 5-4A | 6-4A | 7-4A Capsules: 5-3A | 6-3A | 7-3A| 8-3A | 9-3A Capsules: 6-2A | 7-2A | 8-2A | 9-2A | 10-2A Capsules: 6-1A | 7-1A | 8-1A | 9-1A Fambrough: New classes shuffle landscape Trio heads talented recruiting crop Outfitting teams brings high cost Each team returns just five starters from a year ago when Catholic (7-4) and St. Amant (7-4) advanced to the playoffs. Catholic was the 4-5A champion and St. Amant placed third. Despite those facts, the other 3-5A coaches have picked Catholic and St. Amant as the league's preseason favorites. "The Bears are coming off a season in which the team experienced an unprecedented number of injuries and then a tremendous turnaround that resulted in their third district title in a row," Weiner said. "Due to the injuries an unusual number of young players received valuable playing time. "Though we're not as big as some of our past teams, we have good team speed and will build our offensive and defensive schemes around that speed." Running back Julius Fleming, a first-team all-district team last season, returns to lead the Catholic offense. Fleming, a senior, ran for more than 700 yards last season. Junior Nathan Arceneaux is the new quarterback. Junior linebacker Jason Peters should help lead the Bears on defense. Strong safety Thomas Broussard and defensive back Byron Washington are the other returning starters. St. Amant also graduated a host of players, including quarterback Brian Babin, an All-Metro selection and a Southeastern Louisiana University signee. "This will be the season to see what kind of program we have at St. Amant," Swacker said. "For the first time in seven years we start the season with many new starters and some different philosophies on offense and defense." The Gators must replace their entire offensive backfield. Senior quarterback Joey Guedry gained valuable experience last season when Babin was sidelined with a staph infection. Linebackes Josh Curry and Reggie Chauvin are among the returning starters for St. Amant on defense. Swacker considers Catholic to be the preseason favorite and notes that the other teams may all be capable of beating one another on a given day. Given that notion, Woodlawn is the team picked third in the standings. Woodlawn was 5-5 a year ago. Like Catholic and St. Amant, the Panthers must also replace some key starters. Junior running back Cordero Tate is the lone returning starter in the backfield. Corey Tate and Christian Life transfer Aaron Lodge could also figure prominently in Woodlawn's backfield plans. Defense should be a strength for the Panthers, since linemen Matt Gavin and Daniel Brown return along with linebackers Brandon Bridges and Daryl Hampton. Also back is defensive back Ted Holmes. Although his team is picked to finish third in the newly constituted 3-5A, Acosta is taking nothing for granted. Even though he has never coached in the local league before, Acosta does base his views on past experience. "When I was an assistant at Jesuit, we played against Catholic High and last year when I was at East St. John we played against St. Amant," Acosta said. "We knew year in and year out that Catholic had a solid program. Last year I saw St. Amant and I know what kind of tradition they have. "Anybody who wants to win this district is going to have to go through those two teams. That's in no way is a sign of disrespect for us or any other team in the district. But it's something we'll all have to deal with." Dutchtown represents the X-factor in 3-5A. The Griffins exceeded expectations last season by finishing second in a tough District 7-4A and then advancing to the second round of the playoffs. Coach Benny Saia of Dutchtown is no stranger to most of the 3-5A teams. Saia was the Woodlawn head coach prior to Nettles. "The next challenge for us is moving up to 5A and playing a much tougher schedule than we did last year," Saia said. "Another challenge will be understanding why we were successful last year, and to continue to build on that. "This should be our best team since the school opened, but we'll have to see if it is good enough to compete with the big boys in 5A." Saia must also replace 17 seniors who graduated last season. Fullback Andrew Kaiihue, guard Curtis Taylor and quarterback Ryan Waguespack all return on offense. End Zac Reddix, tackle Damon Altman, linebackers Jordan Lockwood and Kenny Lewis and defensive back Devon James are back on defense. With the return of Nettles, Denham Springs will also go back to more of a traditional look with gold helmets that are similar to LSU. Nettles, who compiled a 20-12 record in three seasons at Woodlawn, knows it will take more than an equipment change to alter the fortunes of the Yellow Jackets. Denham Springs has not made the playoffs since 1995. However, an increase in roster numbers is a plus. So is the return of junior running back Tasmin Stewart and senior center Ian Burks on offense. Devin Pourciau is the new starting quarterback. Linebacker Paul Kinchen and defensive back Tim McGibboney help lead the DSHS defense. Walker was 5-5 last season but graduated several key starters, including LSU signee Chris Hawkins. The Wildcats of coach John Guerin do return nine starters on defense, but may have to play several key players both ways. Running backs Toddrick Stevenson and Cody Reine gained valuable experience last season and will replace Hawkins in the backfield. Linebacker Michael Stevenson, safety Jarrod Baker and cornerback Corey Jackson are defensive players to note. "Hopefully, with the defensive players we have coming back we can give the offense time to mature," Guerin said. "We lost a couple of close games last year. With the defense we have back and if the offense matures hopefully it will allow us to win some close ones." Central, 1-9 in Keith Menard's first season, should be bolstered by the return of 13 starters. Quarterback Tyler Wolfe and receiver Johdrick Morris figure to be the leaders in the multiple-I offense. Safety Zack Morris had seven interceptions last season and should help lead the Central defense.

244	 Main Index Colleges Preps Pros Three-way battle looms for 4-5A crown By CHRIS CHAPPLE Special to The Advocate Fontainebleau emerged last season in the eight-team District 5-5A that is now District 4-5A. The Bulldogs reached the playoffs for the fourth straight season, entering the playoffs as co-district champions with Covington. Fontainebleau won its first playoff game in school history and advanced to the semifinals, where wild-card Slidell also represented the district. "The excitement of last year has carried over into our workouts," said Fontainebleau coach Larry Favre, whose team was 6-1 in district and 11-3 overall. "The kids are stronger and have doubled their efforts. This is the best offseason we've ever had." Slidell (9-5), Hammond (8-3) and Covington (9-2) plan to contend for the District 4-5A title. Other teams in the mix are St. Paul's (6-4), Mandeville (4-6), Ponchatoula (4-5) and Northshore (0-10). Fontainebleau has 22 seniors and Slidell 27.

"You can't have a letdown. You have to play hard every week. Hammond is very talented and always a threat. Covington is the same way." "Slidell, Covington and Ponchatoula really throw the ball well," Favre said. "Other teams run more. I think it's an extremely well-coached district. You have to be prepared every week. Many games come down to breaks and field position." Fontainebleau's strength is in its lines. Grubb said senior offensive tackle Cameron Zipp is considered one of the top linemen in the state. Center Tye Berard, tackle Kyle Plouhar and guards Kris McDuffie and Jared Patterson complete the line. The Bulldogs have all new skill players with junior Ross Goodlet the quarterback. Slidell returns senior quarterback Stephen Liuzza, who rushed for 400 yards and passed for 2,600 yards and 16 touchdowns last season. "Stephen is very agile, quick and strong," Grubb said. "He feels comfortable in our spread offense. He makes big plays. The kid is a football player." Sophomore running back Ryan Tott is back after rushing for 600 yards last year. Senior linebackers Josh Buelle and Nick Schwaner led the Tigers in tackles in 2004. Slidell had 55 of its 75 players go beyond the mandatory summer workouts. Covington running back Patrick Henry returns for his senior season. Henry rushed for 1,507 yards and 12 touchdowns in 2003 and 1,431 yards in 2004. Senior Justin Chatman, a converted lineman, is the H-back/tight end. Senior Blake Ramsey is a force on the defensive line and is being recruited by a number of schools. Senior fullback Matt Betts returns for Hammond. Betts averaged more than 10 yards a carry while gaining 1,745 yards last year. Three senior defensive starters return in tackle Jake Miller, linebacker Troy Giddens, a LSU commitment. and strong safety J.J. Weber. St. Paul's returns its starting running back trio of senior Caleb Bajon and juniors Jared Morise and Jacques Leruth.

247	 Main Index Colleges Preps Pros East St. John, Thibodaux open at top of 5-5A, 6-5A By DAVID STEINLE Special to The Advocate Advocate staff photo by Mark Saltz ESJ coach Larry Dauterive will have to replace quarterback Ryan Perrilloux. Through the first 12 weeks of the 2004 season, the Hahnville Tigers gave every indication they would successfully defend their Class 5A state championship. Coach Lou Valdin's team was ranked No. 1 throughout the season and extended its winning streak to 27 games.? But the Tigers were shocked in the 5A quarterfinals by Slidell, 14-13. Days later, Hahnville was moved away from its traditional rivalries with bayou region teams into a New Orleans-area district. Hahnville, along with River Parish rivals Destrehan and East St. John, are part of the new District 5-5A with John Ehret-Marrero and West Jefferson-Harvey. Assumption-Napoleonville, which moved up from Class 4A for the first time in more than a decade, rounds out the sprawling district. The three River Parish teams were rated as the favorites in the preseason coaches' poll, with East St. John edging Hahnville for the top spot.

The last bayou team to dominate the former district, Thibodaux, has emerged as the favorite in the geographically contracted 6-5A.? The Tigers won four consecutive district titles from 1989-92 and the first Class 5A state championship in 1991, but endured several lean years after that run until last year's 8-3 playoff season. The optimism for the Tigers stems from quarterback Zach Chauvin, a left-hander who threw for 19 touchdowns and 1,321 yards, while adding 336 yards rushing.? Chauvin will operate behind an offensive line that returns three starters, but he will might to carry the load more of the load, as 1,000-yard rusher Edward Morgan is gone. Another team accustomed to success, South Lafourche-Galliano, fell to 2-8 in 2004.? But a strong finish to last season combined with nine returning starters has SLHS coach Tommy Gisclair beaming with optimism. "We have a positive outlook on the upcoming season, even though it was a tough season last year,'' Gisclair said.? "We expect to be in the race for the district championship.'' Also expected to be in the 6-5A hunt is Terrebonne.? The Tigers made the 5A playoffs and return one of the district's top offensive weapons in running back Russell Todd, who rushed for 1,173 yards, along with leading tacklers Brian Lewis at linebacker and Josh Van Buren at safety. "We will be more mature,'' Terrebonne coach Joe Clement said.? "We will be strong and fast on defense and loaded at the skill positions on offense.'' The other teams in Terrebonne Parish all face different challenges.? Ellender will be looking to bounce back from an 0-10 season, H.L. Bourgeois will be looking for its first winning season and playoff berth in Class 5A, and South Terrebonne is returning to Class 5A after four years in Class 4A. Assumption coach Don Torres said the new 5-5A is the toughest district in the state, and Torres may have a point.? His Mustangs, who finished 2-8 last year in a District 8-4A that included eventual 4A champion John Curtis, are the only 5-5A team that didn't make the playoffs a year ago. Torres took his lumps with a young team last year, and it could reap improvement for the Mustangs.? His offensive line returns intact, although he will have to replace 1,100-yard passer Chet Cavalier with sophomore James Landry. On defense, Assumption lost all-state linebacker Yasha Willis, but returns the other linebackers in the Mustangs' 4-3 defense, Terran Williams and Kasdan Oliver. "The offense should be more productive, and we have some returning talent on defense,'' Torres said.? "We need early success for momentum heading into district.'' East St. John lost its all-everything quarterback, All-American Ryan Perrilloux, to LSU, but veteran coach Larry Dauterive has a replacement who has something Perrilloux didn't -- a state championship. Johnny Thiel comes over from John Curtis after leading the Patriots to the 4A title in 2004 and the title game as a freshman in 2003.? Thiel went through spring practice at ESJ, helping his transition from the split-back veer at Curtis to Dauterive's wide-open attack.? A deep group of receivers will make Thiel's transition much easier, led by 6-foot-2 tight end Ricky Dixon and split end Louis Lee. With six returning starters on defense, highlighted by ends Antoine Fulton and Patrick Compton, ESJ should improve on that side of the ball. "We will be attempting to adjust to life after Perrilloux,'' Dauterive said.? "Our ends are the strength of our defense, and we have great depth in the secondary.'' Hahnville team lost 13 starters from last year, most notably quarterback Bryant Lee, who was 27-1 as a two-year starter, and defensive tackle Chris Lanaux. Terrance Isaac, who rushed for more than 1,700 yards, will have to carry the offensive load for the Tigers while junior Larry James gets his feet wet against varsity competition.? Defensive back Kemon Jacobs, linebacker Cory Hawkins and end Kentrell Lockett are the starters back on defense. Destrehan has the lone returnee under center in 5-5A.? Jai Eugene began the 2004 season at wide receiver, but when Shawn Simms struggled in the early going, Wildcats coach Steve Robicheaux switched Eugene to quarterback and reached the second round of the playoffs. Long-time rivals John Ehret and West Jefferson face many question marks on both sides of the ball. Ehret finished with the top power ranking in Class 5A but lost to Fontainebleau in the quarterfinals.? Coach Billy North moved Chris Mitchell, the Patriots leading receiver last year, to quarterback to replace Kendrick Ussin. West Jefferson coach Hank Tierney is never at a loss for words and was blunt when asked about his teams hopes for 2005. "Bleak," said Tierney, who is 209-58 in 22 seasons at Archbishop Shaw and West Jeff. Two other coaches in 5-5A, Ehret's North and Hahnville's Valdin, were assistants under Tierney on Shaw's 1987 Class 4A state championship team. The Buccaneers must replace two-year starting quarterback Mark Ford, but a bigger problem may be the emergence of Helen Cox, a new high school that has siphoned off some of Tierney's top players.?

250	 Main Index Colleges Preps Pros Acadiana appears to be leader of 2-5A pack By BOBBY ARDOIN Special to The Advocate Advocate staff photo by Bryan Tuck Linebacker and LSU commitment Jacob Cuterera will spearhead the Acadiana High defense this season. Could this be the year where tradition is abandoned in District 2-5A? That's a possible scenario as perennial first-place contenders Barbe and Carencro have young teams that are not expected to compete for the title. Instead the coaches have turned their preseason attention to Acadiana High and possibly Lafayette High, two teams that have experience returning in different areas of influence. Some league coaches also think Comeaux High has a chance to challenge for a championship, while Westgate High of New Iberia returns one of the league's most talented backfields. "We feel that our defense, kicking game and offensive line will be the strength of our football team this year, because we have our most returning starters in those areas," Acadiana head coach Ted Davidson said. Davidson, who is in his second season as head coach at Acadiana, feels the cornerstone of the Rams' defense is returning all-district linebacker and LSU commitment Jacob Cutrera along with linebacker Garrett Theriot, who was also selected to the all-league team last year.

Romero, a pair of seniors that give the Rams the most experienced defensive team in the league. When it comes to running Acadiana's veer offense, the Rams have all their interior line blockers back to guide a backfield that Davidson admits is inexperienced. Even Acadiana's kicking game is expected to flourish, as all-district placekicker Martin Latiolais returns. Latiolais will also handle the punting duties. The coaches also feel that a Barousse will again have a chance to capture a district championship trophy. However, this time it will be Mark Barousse, the Lafayette High coach. Longtime Carencro head coach Mac Barousse, whose teams won 11 league championships resigned in June in order to spend time watching his son play for Mark Barousse's Lions. Mark Barousse is 15-18 in his three previous seasons at LHS, but this year the coaches feel the Lions could become a serious player in the race for the championship. Lafayette has its entire backfield returning and that includes senior quarterback Michael McIver, who has started for most of the last two seasons. McIver threw for 1,712 yards and 19 touchdowns in 2004 in Lafayette's spread offense that features two solid running backs. The Lions' Joby Hills, a 190-pound junior, ran for 708 yards last year, while 175-pound senior Rick Griffin gained 707 more. Hills had a 6.3 yards-per-carry average, while Griffin gained an average of 4.7 yards each time he ran the ball. One of Lafayette's key question marks could be the offensive line. Only one player, senior offensive tackle Andre LeBlanc, is the only returnee. The remainder of Lafayette's projected blockers average about 260 pounds, but all are juniors who did not start last season. Westgate-New Iberia returns talented quarterback Jared Mitchell, a 200-pound senior and running back Randall Antoine. Westgate also has all but one position returning on the offensive line. Comeaux's biggest asset is its defense, which features nine returnees including linebacker Trae Fitzgerald, who had 120 tackles as a junior last season. In the secondary the Spartans also have defensive back Devon Bardash, the team interception leader with four. Offensively, there is less experience at Comeaux, but senior running back Corrimizza Charles, a 5-foot-4, 140-pounder is a speed threat. Last year Charles gained 990 yards on 145 carries. Sulphur, an uncharacteristic 4-6 in 2004, is planning to restore its playoff tradition under fourth-year head coach Paul Bourgeois. If the Tornadoes produce a formidable rebuilding effort, it will be due early to the offensive line, which returns four key players on the interior. The rest of Sulphur's team will be young at the outset. Defensively the only key returnee is returning all-district defensive end Casey Broussard, a 195-pound senior. "We're looking to rebound from Sulphur's first losing season in eight years and this year's team will have to overcome the loss of key skill position players," said Bourgeois. New Iberia reached the playoffs in 2004 under coach Rick Hutson, who is starting his sixth season as the school's football coach. This year the Yellow Jackets' hopes rest with a talented bunch of offensive returnees along the line of scrimmage and two senior linebackers, Jordan Lamothe and Steven Camacho. Hutson is especially optimistic about senior offensive guard and defensive end Zhamal Thomas, a 6-4, 315-pound senior, a player who has drawn national recruiting interest. Also perhaps playing a key defensive role for NISH is Thomas' brother, Zedric Thomas, a 5-11, 170-pound junior, who won the Class 5A triple jump competition last year. The situations at Barbe and Carencro are similar -- lack of experience. Carencro is under a head coach Lance Guidry, who inherits a team that finished 6-4 last year. Guidry, the former defensive coordinator at McNeese State, says the Bears will seek to find starters at just about every position offensively and defensively. Barbe coach Jimmy Shaver begins his 24th season as the Buccaneers' head coach, but this year's team is perhaps is most inexperienced ever. "It's a starting over kind of deal with us," Shavers said. "We've had teams that were just as inexperienced in the past, but there was always a good group behind those guys that were able to step up and handle the challenge. "We had 30 seniors on our team last year and we are replacing all of the starting 11 offensively," Shaver said. "We also have seven new guys that will be starting on the defense."

252	 Main Index Colleges Preps Pros Talented Breaux Bridge heads close race for 5-4A title By BOBBY ARDOIN Special to The Advocate Advocate staff photo by Richard Alan Hannon Coach Vincent DeRouen led Northside to the state Class 4A championship game in the Superdome last season. Just how difficult is District 5-4A? Consider this: In the 2004 playoffs three teams from the district advanced to the quarterfinal round, two played one another in the semifinals and Northside High played for the championship. The league is so competitive that despite having 10 starters returning, NHS isn't even the consensus pick to win the title. Most coaches feel Breaux Bridge with veteran coach Mike Mowad guiding nine returnees, will edge Northside and St. Thomas More when the championship trophy is awarded in November. After that the race will probably again be close as NHS, STM and St. Martinville make things interesting. Mowad, who is 161-87 at Breaux Bridge after 22 years, admits that the Tigers are talented this season, but he also feels his team is young and inexperienced. One concern is the Breaux Bridge running attack which has become a tradition since Mowad arrived.

At quarterback, Mowad has installed John H. Williams one of the league's most talented athletes. As a sophomore, Williams was the team's interception leader at free safety (five). He is also scheduled to play in the secondary again this season. Defense, another Mowad trademark at Breaux Bridge, appears in good shape with five starters back. Breaux Bridge also has good size defensively, with the projected starters on the front averaging 225 pounds. Northside coach Vincent DeRouen coached the Vikings on their Superdome postseason run and says that expectations are soaring out of control as the start of this season nears. "That's going to be the toughest part of this year, however I must say that the kids have stepped up to the challenge. They had an outstanding summer. "I just hope that people don't put too much pressure on them or that the players put too much pressure upon themselves. All I've been hearing is that everyone wants to get back to the Dome. "Because of what is expected of us, we've been working hard to do that, but I just hope that we don't overwork it," DeRouen said. One of Northside's biggest problems is replacing running back Keiland Williams, who gained over 2,500 yards during the past two seasons. This year DeRouen said Williams will complete his eligibility at a Virginia military academy. Northside's key area of inexperience is also the offensive backfield, which lines up behind three blocking returnees who weigh 300 pounds or more. The Vikings' entire defensive backfield returns on a unit that is headed by Jarrod Shaw, a 6-foot-6, 320 senior tackle. DeRouen said that Shaw's future has sufficient promise. "Just about every college you can name is interested in him. He's a good student, which will make him easy for somebody to sign," DeRouen said. At St. Thomas More, coach Jim Hightower starts his 20th year at the school and 32nd overall with a 279-89-1 record. Some of the 5-4A coaches are picking the Cougars to win another share of the district title this season, but if STM does so, Hightower will have to discover a starting quarterback. With just three weeks before the preseason jamborree, Hightower still isn't sure who will operate STM's multiple-I formation offense. Besides the major question mark at quarterback, the Cougars are also replacing a talented running attack that gained 3,099 yards last year. Also gone is quarterback John Hundley who threw for 1,895 yards. St. Martinville is probably the most experienced team in the league with 13 players returning. The Tigers have the league's top returning running back in Kennedy Tyler, who gained 1,248 yards. SMSH coach Gregg Hudson said he will continue the Tigers' rush-oriented tradition, proving that the school's Wing-T is no Model-T. "We have six backs that are capable of running the ball and we have a good mixture on our offensive line of size and quickness, which for our Wing-T is a plus," Hudson said. Hudson said the Tigers' rushing attack had a lot to do with last year's success at reaching the quarterfinals before losing to Neville (25-21). "The way that our offense operated at the end of last season and during the playoffs is the type of offense that we should have this year. "We will not be the passing team that we were during the regular season last year, which is just fine with me," said Hudson. After spending most of the last seven years spinning inside a revolving door of coaches, Opelousas appears to have some stability in Paul Lanclos, who led the Tigers to a 7-5 record in 2004 and a regional round appearance. The Tigers' berth in the playoffs was its first since 1996 and the Tigers are being given consideration to finish towards the middle of the eight-team league that has added Morgan City. Veteran coach James Waguespack is back at Beau Chene. Waguespack has spent 38 years as a head coach, but this is his fourth season in Prairie Basse, in southeastern St. Landry Parish. The Gators have the distinction of having the only quarterback returnee, senior Alex Hardy. Beau Chene's biggest problem is defense, with only four starters back. Waguespack recognizes his team's chances of succeeding offensively while the defense matures. "We're counting on tailback Eli Wheeler and Alex Hardy to help carry the load and we feel our receivers led by Carlos Davis, Keven Andru and Chuck Charles will help us have a more balanced attack," said Waguespack. Mark Millett, who was a head coach previously at Church Point and Crowley, was hired in February to coach at Morgan City. The Tigers are moving up from Class 3A with one returning offensive starter and three from a team that finished 1-9. Millett said he's aware of what's ahead. "There are a lot of fine coaches in this district, as good as you will find anywhere. Then from top to bottom, the district is as fine as any there is in Class 4A. Five of them were in the playoffs and three were a quarterfinalist. "For us to compete in this league, I would say is a jump, but it's also a challenge that we will not shy away from," he said. Millett arrived in Morgan City from Abbeville, which also won one of 10 games last year. AHS starts a second season under Keith Calvert, with some experience along the offensive line and at linebacker and at defensive back.

254	 Main Index Colleges Preps Pros Returnees bolster Zachary's chance for 6-4A repeat By ROBIN FAMBROUGH rfambrough@theadvocate.com Advocate sportswriter Advocate staff photo by Kerry Maloney Top 6-4A players include (front row from left) Glen Oaks' Anthony Williams, Zachary's Darrien Matthews, Belaire's Darrell Oby and (back row from left) Scotlandville's Daverin Geralds, Live Oak's Brody Bozeman and Istrouma's Allen Buckner. Bozeman suffered an injury in practice recently and is out for the entire 2005 season. Last year it was considered to be changing of the guard when Zachary High won the District 6-4A football title. The Broncos, who hadn't won a district title since 1992 and hadn't been in the playoffs since the late 1990s, were supposedly setting the stage for several years of success. With 13 starters returning, coach Bob Howell's team figures to be destined for success. Will that success include another District 6-4A title in 2005? The Broncos are listed as the pre-district favorite. However, a realigned 6-4A now includes two top inner city teams, previous 6-4A stalwart Glen Oaks and Istrouma, a top team in District 7-4A the past two years. Also joining the district after a two-year stay in Class 3A is Scotlandville. "This season may be the biggest challenge a Zachary team has had in a very long time," Howell said. "We have shown that there are some young men out here that can play some pretty good football. "We are still trying to develop as a team people expect to see in the playoffs every year. Istrouma has already done that. "This year I expect the competition and the athletic ability in our district to be better. Glen Oaks is always going to be there in contention. They can either be great or at the very least extremely competitive. This year won't be easy for us by any means." HIGH SCHOOLS Previews: 2-5A | 3-5A | 4-5A | 5-5A/6-5A Previews: 5-4A | 6-4A | 7-4A Previews: 5-3A | 6-3A | 8-3A | 9-3A | 10-3A Previews: 6-2A/7-2A | 8-2A | 9-2A | 10-2A Previews: 6-1A | 8-1A | 9-1A Capsules: 2-5A | 3-5A | 4-5A | 5-5A | 6-5A Capsules: 5-4A | 6-4A | 7-4A Capsules: 5-3A | 6-3A | 7-3A| 8-3A | 9-3A Capsules: 6-2A | 7-2A | 8-2A | 9-2A | 10-2A Capsules: 6-1A | 7-1A | 8-1A | 9-1A Fambrough: New classes shuffle landscape Trio heads talented recruiting crop Outfitting teams brings high cost Zachary returns almost all of its entire backfield intact. Toney McDowell rushed for 1,014 yards and 13 touchdowns in the regular season. Ricky James (876 yards, 8 TDs) and quarterback Cothern Williams (561 yards rushing, 553 yards passing) also led the way in the triple option attack that helped showcase the skills of guard Cameron Ceasor, an All-Metro selection. Linebackers Jeff Chapman, Kevin Persick and Darrien Matthews help lead the ZHS defense. Istrouma garnered a top 10 ranking in each of the two previous years while competing in the Baton Rouge area's other 4A league, District 7-4A. The Indians of coach Richard Oliver graduated quarterback Marcus Washington, a 2,000-yard passer, and All-Metro MVP Juamorris Stewart, a wide receiver and Southern Mississippi signee. Fortunately for Oliver, Istrouma returns 17 starters. Top returning regulars on offense include receiver Corey Cushingberry, running back Daniel Porter, tackle Allen Buckner and guard Oscar Square. Stepping into the all-important quarterback spot in the spread offense is junior Henry Brown. Istrouma also returns its linebacking corps of Wilford Franklin, Devin Holland and Chris Williams. "This year is definitely going to be different," Istrouma's Oliver said. "In the other district we played more district games, so dropping down to five district games should be easier. "I think you have to make Zachary the favorite. They won it last year. And we expect Glen Oaks and Scotlandville to be good too, because we've played. There are some other teams, like Belaire and Live Oak, we need to learn about. "We have some people we have to replace. But if we can execute and just play hard I think we can be successful." Glen Oaks, Belaire and Scotlandville are considered to be among the next wave of contenders. Gary Burnett's Glen Oaks squad returns 10 starters, led by quarterback Jarrett Richardson, receiver Carday Clark and two key linemen, Brandon Zanders and Daniel Stevens. The Panthers will sport a large offensive line that will include at least three players who weigh 280 pounds or better. Linebacker Anthony Williams, end Kevin Thomas and defensive back Lester Butler are the top returnees on defense for Burnett. "Zachary has the whole team returning from last year," Burnett said. "They must be the team to beat. "We feel that we have a good group of seniors and should get excellent leadership from them. That's an ingredient we've been missing the last few years. If we can fill some of the spots we have on the line, I think we can be in the mix." Belaire is picked as high as third by some league coaches. However, Belaire coach Ron LeJeune said his team has some key questions to answer in order to be competitive. Unlike last season when injuries forced LeJeune to replace key skill position players, LeJeune sees the offensive and defensive lines as areas where positions must be filled. "We probably have 50 players out for the team, but most of those guys are skill position players," LeJeune said. "I can't remember ever having this few linemen before. "There won't be much depth on the line. But I think there is a chance we may be a little better off at the skill positions. It's going to be a different kind of year." Receiver Jeremy Paul and running back Ricky Spears return to lead the offense for the Bengals. Linemen Patrick Gunter, Darryl Oby and Brian Carter are among the top returning starters on defense for LeJeune. The Bengals return nine starters, six of whom play on defense. Scotlandville figures to be the X-factor for the other District 6-4A teams. The Golden Eagles return to 4A after two years with a new look in more ways than one. For starters, Scotlandville has a first-year coach in Landry Williams, a former standout player at both Glen Oaks and Southern University. The new look will also include new black-and-gold uniforms like the ones Scotlandville had in its pre-magnet school days. The other thing Scotlandville will likely have is one of the area's top recruits in lineman Daverin Geralds, who has already received scholarship offers from several top academic schools, such as Duke and Stanford. Quarterback Kyle Russell and running back Stacey Ducre also are back to the lead the offense. End Andre Coleman and two tackles Jasmoine Clark and Kenneth Banks, are among the players Williams will be counting on to contribute defensively. Live Oak finished 2-8 a year ago and failed to win a District 6-4A game. The league's other Eagles return 13 starters in what will be veteran coach Donnie Bozeman's last season. Bozeman, a former LSU player, is in his second year as head coach at LOHS. His career also includes head coaching stints at St. Edmund-Eunice, Assumption-Napoleonville and Crowley. Bozeman's son, tight end Brody Bozeman, is among Live Oak's top returning players on offense. Quarterback Michael Scarbrough, tackle Mick Jeanise and running back Shawn Mullen are others to watch. Linebacker Derrick Gann and defensive back Hunter Hughes are expected to be among the LOHS players to watch on defense. Linebacker-fullback Darren Leblanc is one of several two-way players to note. "We will be short on depth and will have a few players going both ways," Bozeman said. "Our character has improved with some outstanding leadership from our seniors. That should help."

256	 Main Index Colleges Preps Pros Coaches tab newcomer Tara to capture 7-4A title By ROBIN FAMBROUGH rfambrough@theadvocate.com Advocate sportswriter Advocate staff photo by Kerry Maloney Top District 7-4A players include (front row from left) St. Michael's Danny Collins, Broadmoor's Damian Manning, Lee's David Wheatley, (back row from left) McKinley's Jonard Harden, East Ascension's Marlon Bassett and Tara's Cory Chappell. Change can be a natural part of the evolution of schools and their athletic programs. Few Louisiana districts can say they've changed as much as Baton Rouge's District 7-4A has since the last football season. Gone are four teams that figured prominently either in the statewide Class 4A scene or the playoff picture. The Louisiana High School Athletic Association's most recent classification plan moved Dutchtown, Istrouma, Plaquemine and Redemptorist out of what was considered to be Baton Rouge's powerhouse district. Redemptorist, the Class 4A state champion just two years ago, moved back to Class 3A and took Plaquemine with them. Dutchtown, a playoff team in just its third season a year ago, has moved up to Class 5A. The reassignment of teams moved Istrouma out of District 7-4A and into 6-4A. With that said, there's a natural tendency to think there isn't much left in the 7-4A gas tank. Guess again. East Ascension and a team that drops down from Class 5A, Tara, help lead the list of 7-4A teams preparing for a possible playoff drive that could include some statewide recognition. HIGH SCHOOLS Previews: 2-5A | 3-5A | 4-5A | 5-5A/6-5A Previews: 5-4A | 6-4A | 7-4A Previews: 5-3A | 6-3A | 8-3A | 9-3A | 10-3A Previews: 6-2A/7-2A | 8-2A | 9-2A | 10-2A Previews: 6-1A | 8-1A | 9-1A Capsules: 2-5A | 3-5A | 4-5A | 5-5A | 6-5A Capsules: 5-4A | 6-4A | 7-4A Capsules: 5-3A | 6-3A | 7-3A| 8-3A | 9-3A Capsules: 6-2A | 7-2A | 8-2A | 9-2A | 10-2A Capsules: 6-1A | 7-1A | 8-1A | 9-1A Fambrough: New classes shuffle landscape Trio heads talented recruiting crop Outfitting teams brings high cost Two other teams to note are St. Michael The Archangel, formerly Bishop Sullivan, and Broadmoor. The Warriors move over from District 6-4A and are just two years removed from winning a district title. Broadmoor, another team that moved from 6-4A, has a rich playoff tradition that includes a 4A title-game appearance in the 1990s. Lee and McKinley also return to 7-4A with new looks. Donald Clark begins his first full season at Lee, which has changed its nickname to the Patriots. Bruce Swinton Jr. is McKinley's latest head coach. "Everybody else is picking us ... well, I'm picking Tara," East Ascension coach Billy Beasley said. "Given the fact that they're dropping down from 5A and the fact that they have some high-profile athletes should give them an edge. "Last year this district proved anything can happen. "Dutchtown beat Plaquemine when nobody expected it and Istrouma came back from 17 points down on us. "I feel good about the people we have coming back. But I also go into every game with a healthy fear of the opponent. The teams in the district may be different this year, but they will represent a challenge." The Spartans graduated some key performers on offense, including running back Ty Lewis and quarterback Buzzy Haydel. Kicker-punter Blake Bercegeay was another key loss via graduation. Senior Brady Bourque gained valuable experience at quarterback last fall when Haydel was sidelined with an injury and also played wide receiver. Tayler Templet is the lone returning running back and will be joined by Skip Stewart and Cecil Edwards. The EAHS backfield, however, will have an experienced line that includes B.J. Holmes, Derek LaFosse, Michael Pinnell, Artez Hendricks, Josh Fleming and tight end Derrick Guillory. Beasley has seven defensive starters back led by linebacker Marlon Bassett, lineman Barry Gabriel, linebacker Danny Jones and defensive back Jeremy Lanclos. None of the league's coaches hesitated to pick Tara to finish either first or second in 7-4A. The Trojans are coming off an 8-2 season in Class 5A and feature two of the area's top defensive players in linebackers Brian Duncan and Cory Chappell. "As always our biggest weakness will be our numbers," Tara coach David Prescott said. "We dressed out an average of 30 players last season and had 28 dress out for the playoffs. "We will be above average at the skill positions, but very young on the offensive line. Another strength will be team speed, but we will also have a lack of size at some positions." Running backs Jarius Wright and Jeremy Bullock return to the backfield. Justin Dunn has moved into the spot left by the graduation of All-Metro pick Emanuel Singleton. Nicko Viges takes over at quarterback and becomes Tara's sixth quarterback in as many years. Tackle Quinton Harris, an All-Metro player, is the top returning lineman. Duncan and Chappell lead the Tara defense that also has Dunn back at defensive back, along with two linemen, end James Armstrong and tackle Byron Hollins. "In the past, we've had success because we play extremely hard and have stayed injury free," Prescott said. "It's my hope that 2005 will be more of the same. "In the areas where we're good, we're very good. But there are some weaknesses, especially on the line. We have four seniors who have never played football before and some younger guys who have to come through." St. Michael is coming off a 7-4 record and a playoff appearance. The Warriors graduated District 6-4A offensive MVP Chad Davis but return another 1,000-yard rusher in Danny Collins. Collins is one of eight starters back for the Warriors. Quarterback Matt Machen and tackle Tim Joiner are also among the projected leaders for St. Michael coach Tut Musemeche. The defense returns six starters, including linebacker Matt Stewart, who had 83 tackles last season. End Norman Harrison is another key defensive player. Musemeche is putting the burden of proof on his offense. "If the offense controls the ball until the defensive front matures, we should be competitive when district starts," Musemeche said. Broadmoor returns just three starters from its 5-5 team of 2004. The Bucs graduated top rusher Trent Davis. Two linemen, Patric Fontenot and Chris Neal, should help anchor the latest version of Broadmoor's veer attack. Ben Day takes over at quarterback. The running backs are set to be Nathan Smith, E.D. Lee and Nyoki Mokeba. End Travis is Byrd is the lone returning regular for Broadmoor on defense. Linebacker Damian Manning is among the new starters to watch. McKinley and Lee put together a combined record of 2-18 last season. McKinley (2-8) was the only one of the two teams to win a district game. Two-way starter Jonard Harden (running back-linebacker) is key player to watch for McKinley. Quarterback Dwayne Brazille is a first-year starter in the backfield along with running backs Erin Banks and Dontrell Pounds. The best news for Swinton is that McKinley returns four of five starters to its offensive line, led by guard Andrew Woods. Defensively, the Panthers return five starters, including Harden and Woods. Others to watch include tackle Ryan Guillory and linebacker Leslie Harris. Clark's squad will feature the area's largest player in 6-foot-7, 368-pound offensive tackle Richard Williams. Receiver-quarterback Brandon Davillier, receiver Jonathan Franklin and two linemen, Calvin Favron and David Wheatley, are among the offensive leaders for the Patriots. Darius Wells and Avalon Rogers are expected to be the running backs. Defensive back Aaron Thibodeaux is one of five starters back on defense for Clark. Linemen Dwayne Roberts, Mark Rester and Keith Durr should give the Patriots strength on the front line. Clark remains optimistic, despite Lee finishing 0-10 in 2004 and going 3-37 the past four years. "In the final weeks of last season our kids showed a drive to compete," Clark said. "We hope that this carries over to this year. "I think East Ascension is the team to beat. Tara has a few college prospects and they'll make a run. St. Michael, Broadmoor and McKinley will all be tough opponents. If we can stay healthy and get a win or two early, we can be competitive in October."

258	 Main Index Colleges Preps Pros Sixteen starters make Redemptorist 8-3A favorite By ALEX SONGE asonge@theadvocate.com Advocate sportswriter Mark Saltz Top 8-3A players include (front row from left) Brusly'sTerrence Gay, Redemptorist's Darrell Glasper II, Parkview's Jimmy Rome, (back row from left) Plaquemine'sDarvid Battiste, Capitol's Kendrick Walls, Northeast's Carrlos Wicker, West Feliciana's Westley King and Baker's Corey Sept. For Northeast coach David Masterson, the best way to describe District 8-3A is "brutal." That word comes from the vantage point of a veteran coach moving into what his fellow District 8A coaches termed the best 3A league in the state. Not too many eight-team football districts feature five teams that have advanced to the semifinals of the playoffs at least once in the last six years. Baker, Capitol, Parkview Baptist and Redemptorist all advanced to state championship games in the past six years. Meanwhile, Northeast advanced to the semifinals the past two seasons. Plaquemine, a perennial playoff team, Brusly, last year's District 8A runner-up and a talented West Feliciana squad round out the tough 3A district. Baker, Plaquemine and Redemptorist are newcomers coming from Class 4A, while Northeast moves up from 2A. Speaking of new, District 8-3A has three first-year coaches in Baker's Ken Hilton, Capitol's Chadwick Germany and West Feliciana's Robb Odom. Hilton, who was a Baker assistant when the Buffaloes played in the Class 4A 2001 title game against John Curtis, will be trying to rebuild a Buffaloes program coming off a 2-8 season. Hilton said his team is junior-oriented.

But with the teams (in the district) you can't just pound it. You're going have to throw, too." Fullback Reggie George and linemen Dedtrick Stepter and Anthony Hayes are the top returning offensive players. The only defensive returning starters are safety Corey Sept and end Jeremy Cook. Veteran coach Brady Perry said defense will be the Panthers' strength with nine starters back. The Panthers feature quality skill-position players in running backs Terrence Gay and Chris Butler along with split end Astin Craig. Perry's biggest concern is an offensive line that lost four starters. Injuries and depth are a concern for Perry. Butler, Craig and Gay are projected to go both ways. Capitol returns the bulk of its defense and most of its offensive line. Germany inherits a team that went 2-8 and 1-6 in District 7-4A last season. He has been an assistant at Capitol the last two seasons. Among Capitol's returnees are tight end/wide receiver Kendrick Walls, an all-stater who caught 35 passes for 558 yards and 12 touchdowns last season. Defensive back Dave Clark had four interceptions last season. Other top returning players on defense include defensive back Anthony Wells and end John Smith. The Vikings will be fast again but Masterson said he is concerned about depth and inexperience. The Vikings lost LSU signee Trindon Holliday, a speedy running back who piled up more than 2,000 yards last season. With skill players like wide receiver Teddy Huggins and quarterback Demetrius Rogers, and some quick defenders Masterson said, "top to bottom we might be faster than last year, but we won't be near as big." Masterson said how his players step up in class will go a ways in determining how good they will be. "How the players react to playing in 3A for the first time may be the greatest indicator of the type of season Northeast can expect," he said. Parkview, which advanced to the 3A quarterfinals last season, looks to have the elements for another strong season, even though it lost some talented players. "We lost some superstars," said Parkview coach Kenny Guillot, "but we have some solid players who have been in the program for two or three years." Gone are the likes of Darry Beckwith and Lyle Hitt, a pair of defensive standouts who signed with LSU. Among the losses on offense are quarterback Jacob Lennox. But the Eagles do return all-district players like running back David Armstrong, lineman Ben Zumstein and wide receivers Andrew Maness and Vince Morrella. Meanwhile, on defense all-district players like nose guard Howie Lake, linebacker Kellen Bozeman and defensive back Devin Ducote return. Plaquemine Defense will be the Green Devils' strength with eight starters back. The problem for coach Don Jones is an experienced offense that lost the likes of quarterback Brandon Smith and wide receiver Mario Stafford as well as some good linemen. Smith's total offense was just less than 2,000 yards while Stafford caught 41 passes for 873 yards and 10 touchdowns. Jones will be counting on standout linebacker Derrick Spriggs to replace Dervin Ricard at running back, who rushed for 1,501 yards. Ricard did not return to Plaquemine for his senior season. Redemptorist The Wolves, the defending District 7-4A champions, went 8-3 last season and return 16 starters. Redemptorist, a team with a reputation for a bruising running game, returns four of five linemen and running back Brent Grimes who rushed for 1,124 yards and 19 touchdowns last season. Defensive leaders for Redemptorist include end Jonathan Hollins and cornerback Darrell Glasper. Wolves coach Guy Mistretta said one key for this team will be how fast they learn some new systems. "The big questions will be the emergence of the team leaders as well as how quickly the players adapt to new schemes on offense and defense," Mistretta said. "There will be new coordinators for the first time in seven years." West Feliciana Depth and an inexperienced offense are the biggest concerns for Odom. The Saints have a few players penciled in to go both ways. Odom also has just three starters back on offense. Defense will be a strength for the Saints with nine starters back on defense, including all-district players like tackle Eric Harris and end Westly King.

259	 Main Index Colleges Preps Pros Notre Dame counting on seniors to repeat By BRIAN HUDGINS Special to The Advocate After a youthful Notre Dame of Crowley team reached the Class 3A championship game last season with all of 15 seniors on board, the Pioneers now present a new challenge to opponents in District 5-3A. Notre Dame hopes to benefit from a bit of added maturity. "We have 29 seniors: 14 more older guys," Notre Dame coach Lewis Cook said. "When you have those guys, they are a little more mature. It has allowed us to progress a little quicker than in the past. It gives you a little more depth." Four of those seniors, defensive back David Hensgens, defensive linemen Stephen Hundley and Kyle Jones and linebacker Lance Meche, are starting for the third straight year, forming the core of the Pioneers' defense. "Defensively, you could argue they will be as good as anybody in any class in this area," Crowley coach Brent Indest said. With running back Rick Zaunbrecher graduated, senior running back Scotty Francis and quarterback Andre Robichaux will play an even bigger role for NDHS. For Francis, the new year will include a move to tailback from fullback.

"He (Francis) has been working hard to prepare for that. But the only way to get ready is to do it." A trio of teams, Cecilia, Church Point and Northwest, finished tied for second place in district play and are looking to move up. Cecilia comes into the season hoping to carry over the strong ground game provided last season by Shawn Alexander. With Alexander gone to graduation, the Bulldogs and coach Terry Martin are going to rely on a different set-up this time around. "We have three solid backs and they all bring something different to the table," Martin said. "I am excited to see how they will turn out." Martin said a lesson learned by the Bulldogs last season was the importance of limiting turnovers on offense. "Our first three games last season, our turnovers were incredible on offense," he said. "After the first few games, we started having more negative consequences (for players) when we put the ball on the ground. We did a good job of protecting the ball in the spring game. Hopefully, that can carry over into the season." Church Point is counting on its own running game to get back in the playoff hunt. Fullback Orlando Wheeler was putting together a solid season in 2004 until he was forced to the sideline because of an injury. On defense, the Bears will have a bunch of fresh faces on the line, but all of the starters in the defensive backfield are back. Meanwhile, Indest is heading into his second season at Crowley. ?"We started 15 sophomores last season and most of those sophomores were on defense," Indest said. "We are really looking to improve on defense. When you can't stop people, you can't win. That is a big priority for us." Offensively, Crowley has a couple of returning players in running backs Jordan Landry and Cy Quebedeaux, who combined for 750 yards on the ground a year ago. While moving the ball was not a major obstacle for the Gents, doing it regularly was another matter. "We moved in spurts, but we didn't move consistently, keep the chains moving and keep the defense off the field," Indest said. Northwest rode a veteran squad to a playoff appearance last season, losing to eventual state champion Amite in the opening round. The Raiders return six starters from that squad. Rayne hits the field for the first time under new coach Curt Ware, who replaces Keith Bergeron. Running back Donovan Anderson and receiver Joey Wynn are back, but the early lineup on defense is young, with only two seniors set for action.

260	 Main Index Colleges Preps Pros North Vermilion hopes to benefit from urgency, hunger By BRIAN HUDGINS Special to The Advocate North Vermilion coach Stephen Lotief is fully aware that trying to win the District 6-3A title is not a short-term proposition. Competing within a group that includes perennial playoff participants such as Teurlings Catholic of Lafayette, Erath and Catholic of New Iberia has shown Lotief that the turnaround time between the end of one season and the beginning of the next is a short one. For North Vermilion, last season contained a second-place district finish and a playoff defeat at the hands of Parkview Baptist. "We started this season right after we lost to Parkview," Lotief said. "We have urgency and hunger. We are going at it a little better. The guys who were juniors last year, this is their last go around. I think they are ready to go." That last go-around will be spent trying to overtake Teurlings, the defending district champion.

"We will have to throw some young guys in there," Teurlings coach Sonny Charpentier said. "For the first time in a while we are thin (on depth) and young at certain positions. So that keeps you up at night thinking about it. "We will probably be more selective on offense since we have a few more guys playing both ways. We may need to pound the ball to shorten the clock and control the game." The Rebels' two returning offensive starters, tight end Jeff Roy (6-3, 220) and center Casey Peterson, will play a part in that, along with fullback Benji Hebert (6-2, 245). Charpentier said relying on a bruising running game would not be a big adjustment for the Rebels. "We never threw the ball as much as people thought," he said. "Perception can be misleading." No matter what method Teurlings employs, the younger players will get a long look at the field. "We have a lot of young kids that are pretty talented," Charpentier said. "Luckily for us, kids that have waited their turn have stepped up for us (in the past). Each senior class doesn't want to drop the ball." North Vermilion is led offensively by fullback Travis Broussard, who ran for 1,547 yards and 12 scores on the way to an All-State honorable mention selection. North Vermilion also has a large collection of starters back to help bolster the defense. Senior linebacker Johnnie Shelvin led the squad with 75 tackles last season. Three-year starters Chris Nelson and Dusty Romero are also back to anchor the defensive line. Catholic-NI will have most of its skill position players back on offense with quarterback Josh Boudreaux, fullback Matt Desormeaux and tailback Travis Zacharie returning. However, coach David Comeaux said the success of an offensive line that lost a few three-year starters will play a big role in determining the direction of his squad's season. "If there is one area we need to address, it's the offensive line. Finding guys to fill those positions is key," Comeaux said. Even though all the schools have lost vital players, Comeaux said the player turnover has a minimal effect on the district's competitive level. "Regardless of who loses which players, year after year our district is just tough," Comeaux said. "Each year, no matter what questions other schools have, they reload. "Sonny (Charpentier) does a great job with his quarterbacks and skill position guys. And (Derrick) Fourroux's little brother (Zach), he will be good." Although Erath has lost All-State quarterback Derrick Fourroux, a McNeese State signee, younger brother Zach (6-2, 205, So.), is ready for his turn at the helm. Tackles Jacob Touchet and Travis Bourque will be back to help provide protection for Fourroux on the offensive line, but the Bobcats will have to work a number of new players into the rotation on defense, with only three returning starters. Defensive lineman Jake Boudreaux, linebacker Jacob Broussard and defensive back Micah Boudreaux are the returnees in the Bobcats' projected lineup. Kaplan is coming off an 0-10 season. Coach Craig Manuel will be counting on a handful of returning starters on defense to help steady the Pirates as they prepare for the tough district slate. Linebacker Daylon Jules, the team's leading tackler last season, is back. Both defensive tackles, Spencer Bourque and Cody Castile, are also returnees from a year ago.

261	 Main Index Colleges Preps Pros All-state players return to lead Patterson Advocate staff report The Louisiana High School Athletic Association's latest classification plan shook things up in District 7-3A. Patterson, West St. Mary, Franklin and Berwick remained in the league, but Morgan City was forced to move up to Class 4A. The St. Mary Parish schools welcomed back an old acquaintance to the district -- E.D. White Catholic of Thibodaux. The Cardinals competed in the same district with Patterson, Franklin and Berwick in the early 1980s during an era in which former LSU and New Orleans Saints running back Dalton Hilliard was an All-State member at Patterson. "E.D. White will be a good addition to the mix," Franklin coach Gerald Martin said. "They will come in here and be a factor in the district race." Patterson, 12 returning starters, gets the nod to win the district title. The Lumberjacks have not won a district championship since advancing to the Class 3A title game in 2002 where they lost to Redemptorist.

Center Coby Minton was a first-team selection, and tailback William Griffin, who rushed for 1,380 yards, was an honorable mention pick. But Patterson coach Tommy Minton said finding a replacement for quarterback Brock Landry, a Southern Mississippi signee, is crucial. Corey Hilliard is expected to take over at quarterback. "We return six starters on offense, but the biggest key will be finding a replacement for Brock Landry," Minton said. "Hilliard has started seven games over the last two years, and he has the potential to be a very good quarterback." Defensively, the Lumberjacks will be strong in the secondary with four returning starters -- Tramon Schexnayder, Tarence Calais, Leon Roberson and Jimmy Smith. Minton said the secondary and size along the line would make the Lumberjacks tough defensively. "Defensively, there is more size in the front seven than in years past," he said. "But our secondary is the key to the defense with four starters returning." E.D. White is looking to end its one-year hiatus from the state playoffs. The Cardinals finished 5-5 last season. Achieving that goal could be a challenge for the Cardinals who return a total of five starters. Quarterback Nolan Dumas and tight end John Ledet are the Cardinals' returning offensive starters. EDW coach Kyle Lasseigne said Dumas and Ledet will be key players, as the Cardinals plan to expand their offense this season. "Nolan returns to lead our offensive scheme after virtually all last year," Lasseigne said. "We look for Nolan to continue to work with the program from last year and through the summer as we expand our offense. "But we feel the key to this unit will be the development of our young offensive line." The Cardinals will also be young on defense with three returning starters -- defensive backs Robbie Breaux and Joe Stock and defensive lineman Copeland Robinson. "While we will obviously rely heavily upon our returners, we also expect several younger players to step up and become contributors to our defensive unit," Lasseigne said. "We expect this defensive group to be an aggressive group who will run to the ball well. There was some cause for optimism with our defensive group after the performance against Central Lafourche in the spring." Franklin enters the season as the reigning district champions, but winning another title could be tough with only five returning starters. The Hornets are trying to replace 17 starters from last season's 8-3 team. Franklin returns a pair of offensive starters in wide receiver Jamaal Hilliard and offensive lineman Jeremy Morris. Defensively, Franklin has three returning starters -- defensive end Jvon Smith, Joe Garrison and defensive back Steve Small. "We have to replace 17 starters from last season's district championship team," Martin said. "Probably 90 percent of them started three years for us. But we should be OK this year because we should have good overall team speed and our offensive line should also be a strength for us." West St. Mary coach Andre Lockley said his team has a simple goal for the 2005 season -- return to the Class 3A playoffs. The Wolfpack made the playoffs in 2002 and '03 but failed to qualify last season with a 5-5 record. "Considering what we lost from that senior class two years ago, going 5-5 with a young team last season was quite an accomplishment," he said. "Those guys got a lot of experience last year, so we are expecting to fare a little bit better this season." West St. Mary returns four starters on offense and six starters on defense. Berwick, winless a year ago, has the luxury of returning the most starters in the district with 14 (seven each on offense and defense). The Panthers return four along the offensive line (Samson McKinley, Eathan Breaux, Mario Gros and Justin Bennett) and three skill players (quarterback D.J. Ansslum, running back Michael Dangerfield and split end Quinton Barrilleaux). Gros, Barrilleaux, Dangerfield, McKinley and Anslum are also returning defensive starters. Other returning defensive starters are linebacker Ryan Adams and defensive back Jesse Newcomb.

262	 Main Index Colleges Preps Pros Annual powerhouse Amite to start at top of 9-3A By JASON RUSSELL jrussell@theadvocate.com Advocate sportswriter Despite losing an all-state running back, all-state linebacker, two-year starter at quarterback and an all-state wide receiver, defending Class 3A state champion Amite is still right where it was at the beginning of last season -- the preseason 9-3A favorite among the league's coaches. The Warriors (13-1) lost all-staters Kendrick Perry, Brandon Brumfield and James Burns to graduation. Amite coach Donald Currier said all of that is a lot to replace for the Warriors. "We lost 22 seniors and our offense was hit pretty hard," Currier said. "Our strength will probably be on the offensive line." That offensive line for Amite sees the return of seniors Brent Dufour at center and Paul Langlois at guard. HIGH SCHOOLS Previews: 2-5A | 3-5A | 4-5A | 5-5A/6-5A Previews: 5-4A | 6-4A | 7-4A Previews: 5-3A | 6-3A | 8-3A | 9-3A | 10-3A Previews: 6-2A/7-2A | 8-2A | 9-2A | 10-2A Previews: 6-1A | 8-1A | 9-1A Capsules: 2-5A | 3-5A | 4-5A | 5-5A | 6-5A Capsules: 5-4A | 6-4A | 7-4A Capsules: 5-3A | 6-3A | 7-3A| 8-3A | 9-3A Capsules: 6-2A | 7-2A | 8-2A | 9-2A | 10-2A Capsules: 6-1A | 7-1A | 8-1A | 9-1A Fambrough: New classes shuffle landscape Trio heads talented recruiting crop Outfitting teams brings high cost In the backfield, senior quarterback Antonio Baker will replace departed Walter Mason, while sophomore running back Steven Sibley replaces Perry. While most of the district is the same as last season, newly added Bogalusa, which dropped from 4A, makes it even tougher, along with the likes of Independence and Franklinton still in the mix. "Independence lost a close battle to Lutcher in the playoffs and Franklinton lost to St. James," Currier said. "It's very, very tough and competitive." Independence may be the main competition for Amite in the district race. The Tigers return 15 starters from a team that finished 7-4 last year and lost 15-0 in the first round to Lutcher. "On paper it looks good, but you have to go out and play on Fridays," Independence coach Keith Carona said. "We looked real good in spring on defense. We were very physical versus Kentwood." Independence returns junior quarterback Chris Banks, senior running back Tobyrius Washington and wide receiver Johnell Jefferson on offense. Banks threw for 1,500 yards and rushed for 400 more in 2004, while Washington had 1,100 yards rushing last year. "The district was good before," Carona said. "Bogalusa just makes it tougher. "We were very unfortunate last year as a 10 seed to get a 23 seed in Lutcher. We played a quarterfinal game in the first round. This year, we just have to go out and compete every week, get a high power ranking and do well in the playoffs." Loranger (7-4 in 2004) returns to 9-3A after a two-year hiatus in 9-2A. The Wolves return senior running back Ricky James, who had 1,500 yards and 10 touchdowns. In all, the Wolves return 10 starters. Coach Sam Messina said two areas are key for his team this year. "The strength of this team lies in our offensive backfield and defensive front seven," Messina said. "We have quality returning in those positions and feel that those players are ready to compete." As the other coaches pointed out, the move back up to 9-3A makes that district the toughest in the state according to Messina. "In 2004, six of the seven teams were in the state playoffs," he said. "Defending state champion Amite, along with Independence and Franklinton, pose immediate playoff-caliber challenges. "Then when you add Bogalusa, Pearl River and Albany, you have a playoff-type game every week. That being said, we feel that in 2005, we will be ready to step up, compete and challenge for a place in the playoffs." Franklinton, which finished 8-4 in 2004, returns 10 starters, including junior running back Charlie Lester, who finished with 704 yards last season. The Demons lost to St. James in the second round of the playoffs. Albany (5-5 in 2004) returns 10 of 11 starters on offense and eight of 11 on defense. Pearl River (6-4 in 2004) returns eight starters, but just three on offense. The Rebels will have to replace their entire backfield.

263	 Main Index Colleges Preps Pros Lutcher in unfamiliar territory Advocate staff report LUTCHER -- High school football has changed dramatically for Lutcher High fans and players since the Bulldogs won the Class 3A state title two years ago. Gone is the traditional River Parish-based Class 3A district that featured rival St. James, thanks to the fact that both St. James and St. Charles Catholic of LaPlace dropped down to Class 2A. Now the Bulldogs of coach Tim Detillier find themselves in the newly formed New Orleans-based District 10-3A.

Detillier welcomes back eight starters, three on offense and five on defense, from a 2004 team that finished 7-7 and advanced to the quarterfinals. The Bulldogs will square off against Archbishop Hannan-Meraux, St. Bernard and the New Orleans contingent of J.S. Clark, DeLaSalle, Karr, L.B. Landry and Lawless. "We are in the largest district in Louisiana and have a lot of unanswered questions about our opponents," Detillier said. "We have plenty of inexperience and will be experimenting at several positions in August." Running back Wayne Albert, split end Juan Johnson and center Ryan Bourgeois are the returning regulars back on offense. Defensive tackle Rolando Melancon, a player who missed the majority of the 2004 season with an injury, returns to anchor the Lutcher defense. Melancon tallied 86 tackles and earned all-state honors two years ago as a freshman. End Jordan Gant and three defensive backs, Carlous Brown, Jarron Jackson and Kelvin Morris are the other returning starters.

269	 Main Index Colleges Preps Pros St. Helena reloads, expected to rule 8-2A roost By CHRIS CHAPPLE Special to The Advocate Advocate staff photo by Mark Saltz Players to watch in District 8-2A this season (front row from left) include St. Helena Central running back Christopher Lanclos, Jackson running back Joshua Smith, (back row from left) Port Allen linebacker Tyrone Ferdinand, Episcopal quarterback Erik Miller and University linebacker Adam Kwentua. St. Helena Central returns as the preseason favorite in a revamped District 8-2A. The district has had four representatives in the Class 2A playoff semifinals the last three seasons, a group that includes Episcopal (2002), Northeast (2003, 2004) and St. Helena, which went on to a state runner-up finish a year ago. Defending District 8-2A champion Northeast has moved to District 8-3A, while Christian Life is in District 7-1A. Port Allen, which competed in District 8-3A last school year, is the sixth team in District 8-2A. "St. Helena and Clinton should control the top of the district," Episcopal coach Travis Bourgeois said. "St. Helena is at the point where they reload every year regardless of how many seniors they lose. The other teams should make it a competitive district." St. Helena was 11-4 in 2004. Clinton (7-5), Episcopal (3-7), Jackson (4-6), Port Allen (0-10) and University (3-6) have worked hard to improve. Guy Blanchard is the new Port Allen coach. He ran his team through an overnight boot camp at Camp Ruth Lee. Port Allen had 25 players out for spring practice but increased to more than 40. University coach Johnny Shoptaugh and Jackson coach Domonick Crockett are in their second seasons. Entering his ninth season, St. Helena coach Alden Foster is the dean of 8-2A coaches. St. Helena returns seven starters, including running back Chris Lanclos, who rushed for 800 yards in nine games and led the Hawks with 23 sacks. Lanclos was the District 8-2A defensive most valuable player. Tyvon Jackson, Sam Robinson, Cardara Dillion, Jeroid Sopsher and Robert Bowman (team-high six interceptions) are other returning defensive starters.

"Jeremy has a strong arm and can run," Foster said. "We're going to utilize his athletic ability." St. Helena has lost just three district games in the last four seasons and became the first team in school history to advance beyond the quarterfinals. "We hope to keep it going," Foster said. "We know the district is going to be tough." Clinton returns 12 starters, including 6-foot, 210-pound junior running back Silas Gibbs, who rushed for 1,700 yards the last two seasons. "Gibbs is a hard worker and he's getting better each year," Clinton coach Robert Signater Sr. said. "He's a powerful runner and has a nice build on him. The strength of our team is our running game." Returning defensive starters for Clinton include end Brent Mack, tackle Kenneth Matthews, linebackers Silas Gibbs, Lindsey Wilson and LilAnthony Gibbs and defensive backs Jeremy Perry and Bert Boatner. "We've got pretty good size," Signater said. "Our defensive experience is a plus." Clinton will have a new starting quarterback, either Signater's son Robert Signater Jr. or Terrance Bell. Episcopal's offense will be directed by senior quarterback Erik Miller, who passed for more than 1,700 yards the last two seasons and ran for 500 yards in 2004. Running backs Tim Machen (250 yards) and Kendrick Thomas and offensive linemen Guy Watkins (6-0, 210, Sr.), Alex Pace (6-1, 240, Jr.) and Robert Stewart (5-10, 180, Jr.) are also returning starters. Tackle John Potts (6-4, 240, Jr.) adds size on the line and split end J.K. Awotwi (6-2, 175, Sr.) hopes to stretch the defenses with his height. End Daniel Helveston (5-11, 200, Sr.), tackle Anthony Shultz (6-3, 220, Jr.), linebackers Watkins, Clifton Byrd (6-1, 190, Jr.) and Cameron Price (6-1, 190, So.) and defensive backs Machen (5-10, 155, Jr.) and Thomas (5-10, 165, Sr.) are players to watch on defense for the Knights. "These guys will have to stay healthy for us to be successful," said Bourgeois, whose team has just 17 juniors and senior on its 55-member roster. U-High returns 10 starters, including senior quarterback Michael Evans and senior tailback Brandon Harris, who rushed for 547 yards and five touchdowns in 2004. Senior Adam Kwentua (6-2, 235) moved from defensive tackle to linebacker. Kwentua, who will also play tight end, made 56 tackles last season. Kent Digby (6-2, 170, Sr.) is back after recording 59 tackles and five sacks last year. Digby and Evans are the outside linebackers. "The team quickness has improved greatly," Shoptaugh said. "Our extensive offseason workouts included Korean karate. The team must be able to play all four quarters and not fold up when bad things happen. Kent Digby has the tools to be a big-play receiver." Jackson is down in numbers with just 22 players. Senior running back Joshua Smith leads the offense. The Chiefs have size on the line with senior Anthony Girori (5-7, 280) and sophomores Justin Whitfield (6-1, 270) and Marlon Hollins (6-2, 240). "Our line is one of the strongest parts of our team," Crockett said. "Our skill players will have to catch up as the season goes on." Port Allen's slogan is "Band of Brothers." "We have to stick together," Blanchard said. "With possibly eight or nine seniors starting on defense, we have to rely on the defense to give us good field position and keep us in games while a young offense tries to find its identity." Kurt Murphy (6-1, 190, Sr.) and Damion Dixon (6-4, 180, So.) return at receiver for PAHS. Three players are in contention for starting quarterback. Senior defensive players to watch include linebackers Michael Mack (5-8, 220) and Tyrone Ferdinand (5-10, 200) and defensive backs Kris Trotter (6-0, 190) and Casey Williams (5-8, 163).

270	 Main Index Colleges Preps Pros Port Barre, Oakdale get nod for crowns By JOHN PRICE Special to The Advocate Despite the fact Port Barre returns only five starters from last year's 8-4 season and currently have an interim head coach, the Red Devils are still the favorites to win District 7-2A this season. According to the districts coaches, Jeanerette is also expected to contend for the title. Sacred Heart-Ville Platte, Ville Platte, Livonia and Pointe Coupee Central-LaBarre round of the rest of the predictions. In early August, longtime Port Barre coach Donnie Perron stepped down to take a position with St. Landry Parish after 27 years with the school. Interim head coach Mac Mistric inherits a depleted squad from an experience standpoint. On offense, wide receiver Kyle Belleau, and linemen Alex Wiltz and T.J. Middleton are the only returning starters. Mistric will have to build his defense around lineman Daniel Page and linebacker Belleau, the only returning defensive starters. Jeanerette coach Zeb Simon has 14 starters back from a team that finished three games below .500 last season. Skill position players Jasper Hopes (split end), Jeremy Guy (wide receiver) and running backs Nathaniel Brooks and Quincy Barabin are back along with three offensive lineman (O'Brien Rochow, Lorenzo Williams and Tia Cage). Defensively, all four linebackers (Travis Sereal, Brooks, Williams and Barabin) are returning starters for the Tigers, which also has Rochow (tackle) and Cordero Williams (defensive back) as returning starters.

Defensively, cornerback Shane Ardoin and safety Sammy Fontenot are the only two returning starters for the Trojans. At Ville Platte, Elton Williams' Bulldogs have seven offensive starters returning. Leading those starters is quarterback Hasoni Alfred, tailbacks Jerry Joseph and Costanoza Thomas, split end Chris Soileau, wide receiver Trent Thomas, left guard Kyle Firmin and right tackle Michael Guillory. On defense, the Bulldogs have six returning starters (cornerbacks Trent Thomas and Costanoza Thomas, tackles Firmin and Guillory and linebacker Aquino Freeman). Wayne Williams moves from North Iberville to Livonia where he finds 11 returning starters, including quarterback Zelmo Strickland and four offensive linemen (Charlie Peterson, Matt Hawkins and Tehran Williams). Also back is split end Cody Morgan. Defensively, Peterson (tackle), Williams (middle linebacker), Kerry Cushionberry (outside linebacker), John Plauche (strong safety), David Cavalier (cornerback) and Seth Badeaux (cornerback) round out the returning starters for the Wildcats. Pointe Coupee Central has 12 starters back from last year's winless squad. Split end/lilnebacker Chris Leonard, offensive and defensive tackle Courtland Hurst, offensive guard Josh Duhe, offensive and defensive tackle Jeffrey Neil, running back Travon Smith, defensive end Josh Lee, and defensive backs Derrick Antoine, Hubert VanBuren and Xavier Thornton are returning starters for the Cougars. In District 6-2A, the district coaches like Oakdale's chances to win league title this season. And who could blame them. The Warriors have 16 returning starters for coach Kevin Manuel, including the entire offensive backfield from last year. Quarterback Taimiak Griffin will again run the offense with David Aclie, Nick Plamlee and Joe Myers logging most of the carries. Split end Derrian Webb, wide receiver Rudy Green, left guard Nathan Dyer and right guard Daniel Henry round out the returning starters on offense for Oakdale. Defensively, lineman George Monnette is back, along with Webb at linebacker, Justin Taylar at linebacker, Lincoln Beard at linebacker and the entire secondary (David Helis, William Larry, Reginald Green and Glenn Arterberry). Mamou and Welsh are also expected to vie for the district crown. Mamou welcomes back five starters from last year's semifinalist team, while Welsh has eight starters back from last year's playoff squad. The Green Demons of Mamou return starting quarterback Kendrick Celestine, fullback Joey Fontenot and center Quentin Miller. Defensively, Fontenot at linebacker and Charles Young in the secondary are the only returning starters. At Welsh, tackle Tyler Fontenot and tailback Joe Broussard are the only offensive returning starters. Ends Derek Achan and James Thomas are returning starters on defense along with tackle Fontenot and Charlie Johnson, Beau Gaspard and Kyle Hebert, who all play in the secondary. Iota, led by coach Jeptha Wall, the son of Sacred Heart's Dutton Wall, has nine starters back from last year's team. Tight end Chris Simon, guard Jared Jackson, tackle Joey Klumpp and running back Jake Bourque are the returning starters on offense for the Bulldogs. Joel Reppond (end), Klumpp (tackle), Aaron Lacombe (linebacker), Simon (linebacker) and Zach Meche (secondary) are the returning starters on defense. Lake Arthur has 13 starters back and may be flying under the district radar. The Tigers, who finished 7-3 but out of the playoff picture, join Welsh as the new entrants into the district. Seven offensive starters from last year's playoff team are back, including fullback Lance Bertrand and tailback Asher Bryant. Tackles Ian Woods and Blake Broussard, tight end Curt Bowers and flanker Matt Fontenot round out the returning offensive starters. On defense, all three linebackers (Tony Monceaux, Bryant and Jake Hayes) are returning starters for Chad Lavergne's squad. Rounding out the returning starters on defense are Bertrand (tackle) and Bowers (safety). Pine Prairie will try its hand at football for the first time. The Panthers and coach Bernie Cooley, who has actually been at the school for two years, will jump into the proverbial district fire with a new varsity program. The Panthers have nine seniors and nine juniors in their projected starting lineup.

271	 Main Index Colleges Preps Pros Veteran-laden Sumner seeks another 9-2A title By ROB DeARMOND rdearmond@theadvocate.com Advocate sportswriter Jewel Sumner coach Mark Catalanotto's team knows how to win district championships. After all, the Cowboys haven't lost a district game since 1999. But don't think Catalanotto doesn't realize that the rest of District 9-2A is still gunning for the Cowboys, especially heading into this season. "I feel like (Varnado) has always had some talent. I think Paul (Meyerchick) is doing a good job of getting them together and coaching them," Catalanotto said. "I saw Springfield in the spring against Loranger, and they played well. "Our district is getting stronger, but we can't worry about that," Catalanotto said. "We've just got to go play." The Cowboys return 16 starters from last year's first-round playoff team, including wide receiver Ahmad James, halfback Devin Coleman and senior quarterback B.T. Callihan.

"We have the ability to put points on the board if we go out and execute. Devin and Ahmad staying healthy is a key for us. It's no secret they've got big-play potential. B.T. has been there, and he's throwing the ball well." Defensively, Sumner returns eight starters and must replace linebacker Antwyne Zanders, a University of Louisiana at Lafayette signee, Craig Travis and John Antoon on the defensive front. Sophomore Max Blades returns at outside linebacker, while Kelvin Blades and Shedrick Briggs step in to fill out the linebacking corps. The Cowboys also return their entire secondary. "I'm pretty comfortable with the three linebackers," Catalanotto said. "Don't get me wrong -- you don't replace Antwyne -- but those three guys have the potential to be very good. "I think those other two defensive linemen (Michael Briggs and Cody Wilson) are the key. I think if we get good play from them, we can put a pretty solid defense on the field. We feel like the secondary is a pretty good deal for us." Varnado, meanwhile, returns 16 starters from last season's team, which lost 39-6 to Northeast in the first round of the playoffs. Included in that group is a trio of returning running backs, led by senior Otha Foster (62 carries, 852 yards last season). Also returning are receivers Jovon McKinley and Jordand Hardge. Sophomore Marcus Mingo will be the new Varnado QB, but the Wildcats return three starters on the offensive line, led by tackle Jacque Carrier. "Quarterback is going to be our big thing," Meyerchick said. "That's been our goal all during the spring is to make sure Marcus becomes a leader. He's got the weapons to go to; he's just got to be a leader." Varnado also returns eight starters on defense, but Meyerchick said the key for his team this season will be utilizing its depth. "I think these guys know we can be good as long as we can get some rest," Meyerchick said. "I think the biggest factor is going to be the depth. Our roster's up to 52 players. That's huge for us. "Varnado's always had good athletes and good speed but kind of fizzled. This year, we've got that (size and speed) plus some depth." In Springfield, third-year coach Spencer Harris heads into the season with 16 returning starters from last year's 5-5 team. Sophomore Zeke Jones (938 yards last season) returns at running back, while Adam Freeman, an all-district selection last season at wide receiver, is penciled in as the team's starter at quarterback. But Harris said he likes what he's seen from junior Ross Edwards under center as well. "We've got some good competition going at quarterback," Harris said. "Adam is going to be one of the best receivers in the district. He was last year. Ross is probably a better passer right now. He's not quite as athletic as Adam. We've just got to figure out what's going to be best for our team." The key for the Bulldogs, however, could come on defense, where the team has shifted from a 50 set to a 4-4. Juniors A.J. Johnson and Josh Bridges anchor the defensive front. "We feel like it just suits our personnel," Harris said of the switch. "We're more physical now. We're more mature. This is what I really wanted to run the last two years, but it really didn't matter what defense we ran the last two years because we were pretty bad on defense. "We know we're not going to win or get to the playoffs if we don't get better on defense. That's our main priority going into the season." In Hammond, St. Thomas Aquinas heads into the season with just six starters (three offense, three defense) returning from last season's bidistrict playoff team. The Falcons also lost 17 seniors from last season's squad. "The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away," Falcons coach Randy Johnson said. "We're as green as a gourd. I've got 17 freshmen. It's the best class I've had since 1998. "We may have to pay the piper this year, but if we can keep these guys together, I'm excited. There's a chance that there's going to be five to seven freshmen on the field at any given time." Senior Chris Graves (67-149-7, 848 yards, 11 TDs) returns on offense along with tackle Dek Kent and guard Justin Henderson. "I think it's trying to find a combination from the line point of view and the backs point of view so that we can put something on the board," Johnson said. "The big thing for us is to not get frustrated with all this new blood. Hopefully they'll come in and mature quickly." End Ryan Autin, tackle Matt Goings and nose tackle Ritney Bergeron are the Falcons' returnees on defense. "The three kids that are coming back (on defense), I'm really high on them because of what they've exhibited over the summer," Johnson said. "If you had to build, that's three I'm glad I've got to build around. But how do you divide three into 11? I don't know." Pine, meanwhile, aims to rebound from last season's 1-9 season with 15 returning starters and 26 returning players in the fold. Included in that number are quarterback Aaron Luper, tailback Tomad Magee and linebackers Kelvin Brown, Chris Brown and Ladarrus Carter. Pine, however, could start an offensive line featuring two sophomores, two freshmen and a senior. "If our offensive line can come together, and we can play hard at the skill positions, we've got as much talent as anybody," Raiders coach Billy Passman said. Pope John Paul II, meanwhile, returns 18 starters from last season's 2-8 team. Senior quarterback Richard Guillot and wide receivers Wesley Curry, Matt Albrecht and Brett Posner return as the Jaguars move from a split-back veer offense to the spread. PJP also returns its entire defensive front and linebacking corps, led by defensive end Brent Mansingh.

272	 Main Index Colleges Preps Pros Teams ready to challenge John Curtis in new district By MATT SAMUELS msamuels@theadvocate.com Advocate sportswriter Advocate staff photo by Mark Saltz St. James head coach Rick Gaille is counting on returning offensive and defensive starters. With 19 state championships, John Curtis is an obvious candidate to reach the Superdome again in 2005. The Patriots, who won the Class 4A title last year, drop down in classification this year aiming for No. 20. Despite all of John Curtis' past accomplishments, don't expect the other four schools in the newly formed District 10-2A to just roll over. "We understand John Curtis is very good, but these other teams in the district are pretty good too," Donaldsonville second-year coach Gary Adkins said. "I'm looking forward to playing them because it has to make you better. It will help you in the playoffs and we will be better prepared." Donaldsonville's old District 10-3A foes St. James and St. Charles Catholic, along with Riverside, complete the district. "When you look at the district, one thing that is pretty obvious is to win a state championship, you're going to have to beat one or two of these teams in the district twice," St. James coach Rick Gaille said. For Riverside coach Mickey Roussel, it is more about survival.

"You've just got to survive." The drop in classification won't necessarily mean an easier schedule for John Curtis. "It's going to be very competitive," John Curtis coach J.T. Curtis said. "There are a lot of quality teams with dome experience. You could lose a game and still win it all." John Curtis will have many spots to fill on offense, with guard Andrew Nierman the only returning starter. "We lost a good group from last year," Curtis said. "It's kind of a rebuilding year on offense. We might need time to mature." Kyle Collura is expected to start at quarterback, while Joe McKnight, Blaine Roberts and Jerico Nelson could see time in the backfield. The Patriots do bring back a good portion of their defense, which Curtis hopes will set the tone against some steep non-district competition. John Curtis will open the season by playing Cottonwood (Utah) and then travel to face Daphne (Ala.). "We are going to prepare, practice and perform the same regardless of who we are playing," Curtis said. St. James, which has reached the semifinals six times in the last 13 years, brings back a lot of experience on both sides of the ball. Junior Antonio Phillips returns at quarterback, while Tremaine Dapremont, Luther Ambrose and Javon Keller will return to the backfield. Jason Zenon and Jared Byers lead a strong secondary, while Nick Narcisse returns at defensive end after being moved from quarterback. "We are much further along this season, with better participation," Gaille said. St. Charles Catholic won District 10-3A last season and advanced to the quarterfinal round of the playoffs, but like St. James, has to play two state champions in John Curtis and West St. John. The Comets must also replace a large part of their offense, with senior receiver Casey Robottom the only skill player returning. Senior Matt Heltz is expected to take over at quarterback, while Corey Clay and Matt Walters will see time in the backfield. Senior Roland Ricca will be back at defensive end, after leading St. Charles in tackles and sacks last year. "Offense is our concern area," Monica said. "Defensively, we've got the nucleus but we can't play defense all night. We've got to find a way to score." Riverside hopes to build off last year's 8-3 season, bringing back running back Jarid Caesar, who ran for 1,100 yards and 18 touchdowns as a freshman. A.J. Delaneuville (500 rushing, 600 passing) returns at quarterback, while the defense will be anchored by a strong linebacker trio and secondary. "We should be better than last year," Roussel said. "We need to get off to a fast start and get all the wins we can before district." Donaldsonville brings back every starter from last year's team, which increased its win total by three in Adkins' first season with the Tigers. Senior Demond Chatman (980 yards rushing) returns after earning first team all-district honors in 10-3A, while junior Dean Werner (650 rushing, 450 passing) will be behind center. "I feel like we are going to be a good football team," Adkins said. "We have everybody back, including all the coaches, which I think is a strength. But I think our opponents are going to be pretty good too."

278	 Main Index Colleges Preps Pros False River, CHSPC join changing 1A landscape By DAVID STEINLE Special to The Advocate Advocate staff photo by Mark Saltz False River Academy quarterback Justin Firmin will operate behind an experienced offensive line this season. If there is any district that would be a candidate for the reality TV show "Extreme Makeover", District 6-1A certainly meets the criteria. The Acadiana-based league features seven teams, all of whom seem to have come from somewhere else. Three teams have moved down from Class 2A.?Two were members of the former District 6-1A and now find themselves part of a district with a radically changed landscape.?One remains from what was once District 5-1A.? And one is making its maiden voyage into varsity football. Three teams in the new league made the post-season last year, and two of the three who didn't return a large number of starters, giving them hope that their long playoff droughts could end this year. The two Baton Rouge area entries in the new 6-1A, Catholic-Pointe Coupee and False River Academy, were members of the old 6-1A, but are now part of a district that may be more manageable. In the old 6-1A, the two New Roads teams were faced with the daunting task of taking on three of Class 1A's perennial powerhouses in Dunham, Kentwood and Southern Lab, all of whom have taken home state championships in the past decade, including Dunham last year. That's not to say that challenges are not present in the new 6-1A.? Both Opelousas Catholic and Westminster Christian-Opelousas, move down after making last year's Class 2A playoffs, and although both have significant losses, both are expected to be the front-runners in their new league.

St. Edmund of Eunice, a traditional heavyweight in Class 1A, will also challenge after winning the 5-1A championship in 2004. Rounding out the new conglomeration is a football newcomer, Acadiana Prep. 'This district may not be as tough as the old district,'' CHSPC coach Neil Weiner said.? 'But with two top ten teams from 2A and a 1A district champion forming this district, it will be very challenging for all teams.'' Weiner, the son of Catholic coach Dale Weiner, was an assistant on two state championship teams at Redemptorist and has brought a winning attitude to the Hornets, a team that should build off of a 3-7 record in 2004.? CHSPC has only three seniors on its roster, but also has 16 starters back on a team that is buying into Neil Weiner's program in his second season with the Hornets, who haven't been to the playoffs since 1997. 'After a year of weight training, we are bigger, faster and stronger,'' Weiner said.? 'We hope to complete a district championship immediately.'' With two experienced quarterbacks in junior Matt Laurent and senior Michael Batiste, and a promising sophomore running back in Justin Porche, Weiner's expectations may very well be met.? Laurent threw for more than 700 yards last year in replacing three-year starter Jerry Lee Scott, who transferred to Livonia. The Hornets return their entire offensive line intact, with only one senior among the unit.? Junior center Tyler Traweek, a 215-pounder, was a second team All-District selection last year.? Of this group, only tackle Brett Kyser is expected to go both ways. On defense, CHSPC will start 11 underclassmen, and feature linebacker Taylor Cottano, who led the team with 78 tackles as a sophomore.? Junior end Jonathan Saizon and freshman linebacker Justin Belone also are cornerstones the Hornets' new 3-5-3 scheme. 'Saizon and Cottano are team captains whom we will lean on for support,'' Weiner said.? 'Changing to the 3-5-3 will allow us to utilize speed to make stops.'' For False River, hopes are high for a return to the playoffs for the first time since 1997.? The Gators are on their third coach in as many seasons, but this time, the new leader brings a winning tradition. Scott Allen coached for 10 seasons at parish rival Livonia, where the Wildcats went 57-47 during his tenure and reached the Class 2A playoffs seven times. 'These kids have worked hard and want to improve this football program,'' Allen said Quarterback Justin Firmin, who accounted for 1,000 yards of total offense, will operate behind an offensive line that, like CHSPC, returns all five starters, including three who started as sophomores last year. Six starters return for the Gators on defense, but Allen must replace cornerback Chad Ourso, who picked off five passes and won district Most Valuable Player honors on defense.? But FRA should still be strong in the secondary, with three starters returning, including junior Nick LeCoq (6-2, 185) and Firmin (6-2, 170). Opelousas Catholic must break in a new offensive line and lost all-state running back Dustin Miller, but the Vikings return speedy receiver D'Andre LeDay and five starters on defense. 'The outlook is good,'' OCHS coach Doug Guillory said.? 'But we have to hope the injury bug stays away.'' Across town, Westminster returns six starters on offense, led by quarterback Ryan McCombie and four starters on the offensive line, but must replace eight starters on defense. St. Edmund will feature 44 freshmen and sophomores on a 55-man roster, but return one of the district's best two-way players in 6-foot-1, 240-pound defensive end/tight end Chris Cormier. North Central hasn't made the playoffs since 2000, its last year in Class 1A before this season.? Even with the move down, the Hurricanes will struggle, as coach Herb Lamb returns only three starters. Acadiana Prep begins its program under a familiar face in coach David Barham, who coached at Westminster Christian before moving to Christian Life Academy for two seasons.? Among Barham's assistants is former Vermilion Catholic coach Charlie Cryer, a former LSU offensive tackle who coached VCHS to the 2003 Class 1A state championship.

279	 Main Index Colleges Preps Pros Four-way 8-1A title chase expected By DAVID STEINLE Special to The Advocate The 2004 season was something totally out of the ordinary for District 8-1A. For one of the usual powers of the district, Loreauville, it was a rare off year.? Coach Kirk Crochet's team, which has been accustomed to finishing at or near the top of the league, fell to fourth place, but still reached the playoffs despite a 4-6 record, only to lose to district rival Vermilion Catholic in the first round. For VCHS, the playoff victory over its long-time rival was a highlight of a roller-coaster season.? Coming off the 2003 Class 1A state championship team, the Screaming Eagles had to replace its leading rusher from the title team, Joe Simon, but had plenty of players on both sides of the ball back to make a run at defending their title. But with two weeks to go in the regular season, VCHS fired the coach who led it to the state championship. In an internal investigation, it was discovered that Charlie Cryer, a former offensive lineman at LSU, lacked the required certification to serve as a head football coach under Louisiana High School Athletic Association by-laws. VCHS couldn't get past a second district rival in the playoffs, as the Eagles were ousted by Hanson Memorial of Franklin.? HIGH SCHOOLS Previews: 2-5A | 3-5A | 4-5A | 5-5A/6-5A Previews: 5-4A | 6-4A | 7-4A Previews: 5-3A | 6-3A | 8-3A | 9-3A | 10-3A Previews: 6-2A/7-2A | 8-2A | 9-2A | 10-2A Previews: 6-1A | 8-1A | 9-1A Capsules: 2-5A | 3-5A | 4-5A | 5-5A | 6-5A Capsules: 5-4A | 6-4A | 7-4A Capsules: 5-3A | 6-3A | 7-3A| 8-3A | 9-3A Capsules: 6-2A | 7-2A | 8-2A | 9-2A | 10-2A Capsules: 6-1A | 7-1A | 8-1A | 9-1A Fambrough: New classes shuffle landscape Trio heads talented recruiting crop Outfitting teams brings high cost The team that eventually won the district championship, Central Catholic of Morgan City, had its own problems.? CCMC headed into district at 1-4 after, but rallied behind all-state quarterback David Burch to roll through the district undefeated and reach the quarterfinals, where the Eagles fell to Oak Grove. Even though the four playoff teams from a year ago all have major question marks at several positions, the quartet is expected to vie for the district championship.? The two other teams in the district, Delcambre and Gueydan, are still trying to catch up to the rest of the league. Both St. Mary Parish teams in the district enter the season with new coaches and new quarterbacks. At Central Catholic, David Fuhrer takes over for Hud Jackson.? Burch, who passed for 2,800 yards and was also the state Most Valuable Player in baseball, will be replaced by senior Eric Matte, but Burch's top targets, receivers Jamarr Garrett and Jeremy Watson are back, as are tackles Trey Guidry and Zach Case. The Eagles will rely on an experienced defense while the offense takes time to jell.? Seven starters return on the defensive platoon, including Garrett at defensive back and Guidry at defensive end.? Fellow defensive backs Travis Whipple and Dallas Francis also return, but CCMC will have a big hole to fill in all-state linebacker Marvin Smart, now at Nicholls State. Sam Dusky inherits his first coaching job at Hanson with a lot of questions.? The Tigers lost one of the state's most versatile players in Blaise St. Blanc, who rushed for 1,339 yards and also handled the place-kicking duties.? The lone returnees on offense are tackle William Keenze and center Ian Clark, an all-state selection.? On defense, Dusky was facing indecision at three of the four secondary spots, but has back his leading interceptor, cornerback Cedric Dupas (five) and leading tackler, linebacker Garrick Spain (124). VCHS graduated another offensive anchor from its state championship team, as quarterback Frankie de Graauw, who passed for more than 1,600 yards last year, is gone.? But leading rusher Broc Prejean, who gained 1,200 yards in taking over for Simon, is back, as is fullback Andrew Hulin, who gained 400 yards. 'We have a very talented and experienced senior class,'' said VCHS coach Chad Mahaffey.? 'We just have to find a replacement for an elusive quarterback.'' Mahaffey is concerned about a lack of depth, as several players will be forced into action on both sides of the ball, which was not the case on the 2003 championship team.? Six starters return from last year's defense, including linebacker David Bradley, who earned MVP honors in the state championship game as a sophomore. 'We will certainly feature more two-way players than VCHS is used to,'' Mahaffey said.? 'We have a lot of speed in this unit, and we certainly expect Bradley to lead our team.'' With 13 starters back, including eight on defense, and a schedule that features four home games to begin the season, Loreauville will have an opportunity to reverse last year's rare losing season. 'With the return of many starters, we should be a more confident team this year,'' said Crochet, who enters his 28th season at Loreauville with a 191-111 record.? 'We improved toward the end of last year, so hopefully that will translate into a better start this year.'' Crochet was still trying to decide on a starting quarterback as the season approached between junior Jude Dugas or senior Logan Waguespack.? Whomever gets the snaps under center will be operating behind an offensive line that returns three starters. The Tigers have been traditionally strong on defense under Crochet, and that tradition should continue this season as eight starters return.? The secondary returns intact, with three of four starters back on the defensive line. Gueydan will look to get back to the playoffs after a two-year hiatus, but coach Jay Landry faces concerns with depth, especially along the lines. All of Landry's players will be forced into two-way action, and the Bears will be breaking in an entirely new offensive line consisting of five sophomores.? But Gueydan does have solid skill position players, led by quarterback Heath Abshire, wingback Tobie Bodreaux and fullback Kentri Duncan. Like Loreauville, Gueydan will be reliant on defense, as seven starters return.? Abshire and Duncan will also see time at linebacker after starting there last season. Gueydan's Vermilion Parish rival, Delcambre, also has to break in a whole new offensive line and returns several starters on defense.? Running back Josh Dorn returns after leading the Tigers with 570 yards rushing last year. Coach Darcy Delcambre is going with a 4-4 defense to take advantage of the Tigers' strength on the defensive line and at linebacker.? Delcambre has the district's longest playoff drought, with its last appearance back in 1999.

280	 Main Index Colleges Preps Pros Trio not lacking in talent in hopes of claiming 9-1A title By CHRIS CHAPPLE Special to The Advocate West St. John was the last team standing in the Class 2A football ranks the last two years. West St. John dominated St. Helena Central, 46-2, to win its third Class 2A title in seven years. The Rams are dropping down into District 9-1A. "With the Louisiana High School Athletic Association forcing all teams to play down to their enrollment, our district warmly welcomes two-time defending Class 2A state champion West St. John," East Iberville coach Dean Buckland said. "West St. John coach Laury Dupont has created a strong tradition that will challenge defending district champ St. John for the title of 9-1A." West St. John returns seven starters from its 12-3 team. Senior receiver Tiarus Jenkins (700 yards, 9 TDs) and senior running back Josh Johnson (500 yards) return, replacing Class 2A offensive MVP Patrick Jackson (3,016 yards rushing, 54 touchdowns). "Being highly successful in the past years, our kids know how to compete on a very high level," Dupont said. "We have good size, strength and quickness. We do need to develop depth on our offensive and defensive lines and work on the kicking game."

Senior running back Chase Blanchard (5-foot-10, 170 pounds) rushed for 1,200 yards and 15 touchdowns. He had 231 receiving yards. Junior quarterback Baco Romero and junior running back Kendrick Williams are returning starters. Senior tackle Drew Mire (5-10, 255) leads the offensive line. Defensive players to watch are junior tackle Jeffrey Williams (6-3, 235), ends Kenny Derouen and Trenton Scott, cornerback Chris Bujol (team-high four interceptions in 2004) and linebackers Blanchard, Kendrick Williams, Bryan Troxclair and Trent Bourgeois.. "We should be better in the offensive trenches and overall have more experience back on offense," St. John coach Erik Willis said. "We have underclassmen eager to prove they can fill the void on defense. With continued hard work and a relatively injury-free season, we are looking forward to another great year in Plaquemine. We're having a great camp." Ascension Catholic (3-7), East Iberville (3-7), North Iberville (4-6) and White Castle (0-10) are other teams looking for improvement. ACHS returns 15 starters, including eight on defense. Senior quarterback Warren Couch is back at the helm. Junior running back Karon Williams and wide receiver Marlon Dominique are other key skill players. Returning linebackers include Jake Robert, Ryan Pizzolato and Steele Tortorich. "We look for our 13 seniors to lead us to a return to the playoffs after a one-year absence," ACHS coach Kirk Delatte said. White Castle returns 18 starters for coach Glenn Lee's second season.? Senior Damien Turner, who passed for 1,246 yards in 2004, is back at quarterback. Other top returning offensive players include guard Jarmarcus Stevenson, center Darryl Edwards and running backs Roderick Anderson and Glenn Sanders. Defensive back Sanders, end Marlon Batiste and tackle Stevenson are players to watch on defense. "An improved coaching staff and facilities and many returning starters and experience should put White Castle in position to show significant improvement," Lee said. North Iberville has a new coach in Bruce Hoffman, while East Iberville's Buckland is in his second season. Junior Sean Stockman (6-3, 175) passed for 941 yards and 11 touchdowns for NIHS last year. Deldrick Knight (16 catches, 268 yards) and Belfred Pryer (14 catches, 238 yards receiving, 365 rushing) and Franklin Wilson (247 rushing) are back. Brandon Webb (6-2, 250, Jr.) led the Bears with 74 tackles last year. He has moved from defensive end to inside linebacker. Quarterback Chris Schultz (6-2, 220) returns to pace East Iberville. Schultz passed for over 1,700 yards and 18 touchdowns as a junior. Senior guards Leevon Zedlitz (6-4, 320) and Robert Jones (5-10, 260) anchor the offensive line. Sophomore running back Jamaal Dunbar is back. Dunbar made 23 catches and scored eight touchdowns last year. Defensive players to watch for the Tigers include senior end Chris Schultz (6-2, 220), tackle Zedlitz and defensive back Keon Reddix.

Clear 93°   2theadvocate > On WBRZ WBRZ-DT13 Programming Schedule From our Director of Engineering: The National Association of Broadcasters reports 1,233 DTV stations in operation. These stations are in 207 TV markets covering 100% of U.S. TV households. Currently, 87.24% of the more than 106 million US TV households are in markets that have 5 or more DTV stations and 67% have 8 or more. 36 markets have all local stations broadcasting DTV. Baton Rouge is one of five TV markets in Louisiana with DTV stations in operation. ?On Air? testing of WBRZ-DT Channel 13 began March 18, 2002. Transmission of programming began on April 22, 2002. WBRZ-DT now broadcast 24 hours a day. Programming on 13-1 consists of the regular schedule of WBRZ in SD and HD programs from the ABC Network, as they are provided. On 13-2 weather maps, radar, and NWS radio are broadcast. The program listing for WBRZ-DT can be found on this web-site under ?What?s On 2?. WBRZ-DT is broadcast from our transmitter site 10 miles south of Baton Rouge, If you can receive DTV please e-mail clyde@WBRZ.com and let us know what you think. Tech Note: FCC will require all over-the air DTV tuners in all TV sets by 2007. This order adopted on August 8 requires that all new sets with screens larger than 13 inches have DTV tuners after July 1, 2007. Half of sets with screens 36 inches and larger must include DTV tuners by July 1, 2004 and all by July 1, 2005. Half of sets 25-35 inches must have DTV tuners by July 1, 2005 and all by July 1, 2006. All sets 13-24 inches must have tuners by July 1, 2007. A major component of high definition TV is the pixel. The pixels display red, green and blue information. Vertical and horizontal resolution refers to these pixels lined up going up and down and across the screen of a TV. HDTV offers the potential for approximately twice the horizontal and vertical resolution of current analog or NTSC television. When combined with the 16:9 wide screen format, this can result in about 5 times as much visual information as analog TV. This is approximately one million pixels per frame of video with 30 frames per second. The difference can be dramatic.

The ripples and the depth of the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina will affect the Southern University football team throughout the season. "Every week is going to be challenging just to see if we can even have a game," SU coach Pete Richardson said. The Jaguars' season opener Saturday at McNeese State was canceled Tuesday. Now, with the school's F.G. Clark Activity Center being used as a shelter for refugees and hotels in Baton Rouge and across the South being used by evacuees, the logistical challenge of trying to stage a football season is being evaluated on a week-by-week basis. The biggest challenge to the entire season -- staging Bayou Classic XXXII -- is yet to come. The game is scheduled for Nov. 26 in the Superdome in New Orleans.

Nestled among upscale shops and eateries, Champps seems to be aimed at several markets, including the lunch, dinner and late-night crowds. Atmosphere goes a long way, and Champps won't have any problem there. The open floor plan features several dining areas, a comfortable bar and at least a dozen televisions broadcasting a wide range of shows. (And of course, the big-screen TV in the main dining room is always tuned to the sports event of the day.) Noteworthy Due to the devastation of Hurricane Katrina and the enormous number of people misplaced, events in at least two major entertainment venues have been canceled indefinitely. Both the Cajundome in Lafayette and the River Center in Baton Rouge have been designated as shelters for hurricane victims. Please call these arenas if you have questions about upcoming events or ticket refunds. Advertisements FEATURES

400	Server: Netscape-Enterprise/2.01 Date: Sun, 04 Sep 2005 00:28:24 GMT Content-type: text/html 2theadvocate.com - On WBRZ [an error occurred while processing this directive] [an error occurred while processing this directive] Radar | Weather Warn Quick Cast | Extended Conditions Baton Rouge, La. Clear 93°   2theadvocate > On WBRZ FAQs About Digital and High Definition Television ? What is Digital TV? WBRZ-DT Channel 13 (DTV) is clearer pictures, better sound, more programming and more viewing excitement than traditional analog television. DTV offers a picture free of "ghosts," "snow" or interference. The crisper, sharper image is due to the increased number of pixels the digital signal puts on the screen - the higher the number, the sharper the picture - and High-definition Television (high definitionTV) has the highest resolution available. Furthermore, high definitionTV has CD-quality surround sound, adding to the ultimate home theater experience. DTV also enables broadcasters to multicast, bringing viewers multiple channels of over-the-air programming simultaneously in a Standard-definition Television (standard definitionTV) format. ? Why is Digital TV better than "regular" analog TV? WBRZ-DT brings viewers five times the picture resolution and clarity of analog TV, making viewers feel like they are right in the middle of the action on their screens. DTV uses binary code, the same system of ones and zeroes that runs on computers and digitally recorded compact discs. Switching TV broadcasts to digital is like switching from cassette tape to compact disc or from a VHS tape to a DVD - the pictures are clearer, and sound is improved, giving viewers the opportunity to experience their favorite programs on a whole new level. In addition, with a 16:9 aspect ratio compared to today's 4:3 aspect ratio of analog television, DTV lets viewers see wide screen images. ? Will consumers have to pay to receive Digital TV broadcasts? No. Unlike digital cable where consumers pay monthly fees for services, WBRZ-DT provides high quality programming with over-the-air broadcasting. ? What about my existing analog TV? Until the total conversion to DTV is made, WBRZ will generally simulcast the same programs on two different channels - WBRZ-DT Channel 13 in a digital format and WBRZ Channel 2 in analog. Viewers with analog sets will be able to convert a digital signal to an analog signal by hooking up a digital tuner decoder box to their sets; however, they will not be able to experience the crystal clear pictures and sound quality that an high definitionTVset provides, nor will they experience the advantages of data-casting or Interactive-television. ? What are the different signals that viewers will see on a DTV? WBRZ-DT has the flexibility to bring viewers programming on different types of digital signals - ranging from high-definition to standard-definition- DTV signals have better resolution than analog TV, which has been in use for more than 50 years. High-definition digital signals also have five times the resolution than that of analog. With DTV, WBRZ-DT can send various signals to consumers, including: High-definition Television (high definition TV) - An high definitionTV signal allows WBRZ-DT to transmit a wide-screen picture with many times more detail than is contained in current analog TV pictures. high definitionTV brings viewers programming so crisp and clear, it produces an image as sharp as reality. In addition, high definitionTV offers unsurpassed audio quality. Standard-definition Television (standard definition TV) - An standard definitionTV signal is another type of signal that viewers experience through DTV. While standard definitionTV signals eliminate ghosting and snow, they are particularly remarkable because they occupy less space on the allocated spectrum than high-definition signals and bring viewers multiple channels of free, over-the-air programming from the same station. In effect, one Digital Television signal has the ability to carry either a program broadcast in high definitionTV, and in some cases one additional standard definition signal, or several programs broadcast simultaneously in Standard-definition Television. For example, rather than having only WBRZ-DT Channel 13, DTV creates the possibility of channels 13-1,13-2,13-3 and 13-4 each carrying a different program. ? What should consumers look for-when shopping for a new TV set today? When shopping for a new TV set, consumers today have many choices: An integrated Digital TV set - This option allows viewers to receive analog and digital signals. An integrated set can project high-definition (high definition), or standard-definition (standard definition) signals. An high definitionTVset has the highest resolution available and provides the ultimate home theater experience. An integrated DTV set provides consumers the most convenient, hassle-free way to experience Digital TV. A Digital TV monitor and a separate digital tuner decoder box - This option allows consumers to upgrade to Digital TV when ready. If consumers choose to purchase only a Digital TV monitor, they will get a wide-screen format and improved picture. In order to receive an over-the-air signal with a Digital TV monitor, consumers must purchase a set-top decoder box. These boxes may be used with high definition, or standard definition monitors. An analog set - If consumers buy an analog set today, they will not receive any of the benefits of Digital TV, including the clearest pictures and sound ever available. Because an analog set does not have a digital tuner, consumers will have to purchase a digital tuner decoder box to watch Digital TV. ? Are the new DTV sets readily available? Digital TV sets are available at both retail stores nationwide as well as online. Like CD players, computers and personal digital assistants, the prices for Digital TV sets continue to drop as the technology becomes more prominent. In fact, prices for Digital TV sets have decreased by 50 percent over the last two years and are available in stores today starting at under $2,000. Equally important, sales of DTV monitors and sets. According to the Consumer Electronics Association, manufacturer-to-retailer sales figures of DTV monitors and sets in October 2001 showed a 113 percent increase over - October of the previous year. October 2001 saw 87,464 DTV sets and monitors shipped from manufacturers to retailers. As of the end of October, 1,050,460 DTV units had been sold in 2001. CEA projects that 2.1 million Digital TV products will be sold in 2002, 5.4 million in 2004, 8 million in 2005 and 10.5 million in 2006. ? Do I need to convert to digital right away? The Digital TV transition is happening now. More than 225 local stations in more than 75 markets are broadcasting a digital signal, ensuring that more than 70 percent of U.S. TV households live in a market with a digital signal. ? If I have digital cable, do I have Digital Television? If I buy a Digital TV, will it work with digital cable? Digital cable is not the same as Digital Television. First, Digital TV can deliver picture quality superior to that of digital cable. Second, most cable companies do not yet carry broadcasters' digital signals. Digital cable refers only to how signals are transferred across cable. Moreover, because there are not yet universal inter-operability standards, a digital set that is plugged into a digital cable set-top box only will receive an analog signal, with-holding all the advantages of Digital Television from a consumer.

"How do you win 2une In trivia?" Well, the answer to that question is: It takes patience, knowledge and a little luck! We have asked the winners for their advice and here are some tips on winning: Be patient! Early callers are often disconnected because we want to give everyone a fresh chance at winning. Timing is everything! The best time to call is when you hear Whitney say, "We have just cleared the phone lines..." or when you see the question on the screen. Watch Whitney's fingers! We hate to pick on poor Whit, but when you see her punch the phone line, she is clearing the line. Sometimes the question is on the screen during this, but keep an eye out nonetheless! Wait on the last digit! This tip came from a faithful viewer who has won several times. She told us her secret and now it's out! She dials 336-232...and waits until the last second to dial 1. Study your history! Todd is a history buff and quite often the question is about something that happened today in history or a famous person's birthday. For example, if it were Huey P. Long's birthday, you can bet the question will be about the man known as Kingfish! What's your secret? Email us your tips and secrets... We promise not to reveal them! Of course, if you want to share, we can post them here! FEATURES

This fall, more than 40 million students will head off to class with backpacks slung over their shoulders; about 20 million of them will be carrying twice the recommended weight on their backs. Improperly used and overloaded backpacks can lead to painful neck and back problems that may last a lifetime. According to a recent survey conducted by the North American Spine Society (NASS), in the past year 42.6% of NASS member physicians have treated children or teens suffering from back pain or spine trauma caused by overloaded or improperly used backpacks. The diagnoses range from cervical, thoracic and lumbar strain to spondylolysis, a stress fracture in one of the vertebrae that make up the spinal column. To raise awareness of this issue, the North American Spine Society offers the ABCs of Backpacking - tips for parents and students in backpack injury prevention. A:  Allow wheels - 31.7% of those surveyed recommend using a backpack on wheels. This type of back pack is helpful if a child is already symptomatic or if parents anticipate that he/she will be carrying loads more than 25 lbs. B:  Back to basics - 20.8% of the spine specialists polled recommend the traditional style backpack. If you opt for this style, make sure the pack has two thick, padded straps along with a waist strap for added lumbar support. C:  Comfort counts - 30.7% of NASS members recommend that parents don't buy the first back pack they see. It's important to make sure the backpack feels comfortable to the child and the straps can be adjusted for a tight fit. D:  Don't overload - Whatever backpack style parents choose for their children, it's important to remember that what's inside that really counts! In fact, 64% of those surveyed claim that overloading the pack is the number one way children and teens improperly use their backpacks. All of the doctors surveyed agreed that the size of the pack should be proportionate to the child, NOT to the size of the items he will be carrying. E:  Everything is too much - Pack only what you need! NASS members recommend that the pack should weigh no more than 10-15% of the child's body weight. F:  Fit your frame - Always use both straps and adjust them snugly on your shoulders. G:  Get organized - Organize the pack so the heavy items are closest to your back. Use smaller compartments to help store loose items and distribute the weight evenly. H:  Heavy hurts! - Don't carry more than you can handle. Make frequent stops to unload the pack. If parents are concerned about the heavy school loads children and teens are carrying on a daily basis, they should : Contact the school and work with teachers to identify ways to lighten the load. Purchase two sets of books - one set for home and the other to be left at school (another cost effective option is to make photocopies of the week's book chapters at the library). Encourage children to be active and to strengthen the muscles in and around the back and neck to protect and aid in injury prevention.

Fighting mosquito bites reduces your risk of getting this disease, along with others that mosquitoes can carry. Take the commonsense steps below to reduce your risk: Avoid bites and illness Clean out the mosquitoes from the places where you work and play help your community control the disease Something to remember: The chance that any one person is going to become ill from a single mosquito bite remains low. The risk of severe illness and death is highest for people over 50 years old, although people of all ages can become ill. A wide variety of insect repellent products are available. CDC recommends the use of products containing active ingredients which have been registered with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for use as repellents applied to skin and clothing. Of the active ingredients registered with the EPA, two have demonstrated a higher degree of efficiency:  Products containing  DEET (N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide) and Picaridin (KBR 3023) are your best bets.

Home Page Main Sports Football 2K5 SU Sports Flashbacks Schedule 2005 Signees All-Americans Scores Schedule Rankings Standings Statistics Roster Schedule Track and Field Bowling Soccer Every week challenging for SU By JOSEPH SCHIEFELBEIN jschiefelbein@theadvocate.com Advocate sportswriter The football coachspeak about taking one game at a time may never be more appropriate. The ripples and the depth of the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina will affect the Southern University football team throughout the season. "Every week is going to be challenging just to see if we can even have a game," SU coach Pete Richardson said. The Jaguars' season opener Saturday at McNeese State was canceled Tuesday. Now, with the school's F.G. Clark Activity Center being used as a shelter for refugees and hotels in Baton Rouge and across the South being used by evacuees, the logistical challenge of trying to stage a football season is being evaluated on a week-by-week basis. Advertisement The biggest challenge to the entire season -- staging Bayou Classic XXXII -- is yet to come. The game is scheduled for Nov. 26 in the Superdome in New Orleans. "We haven't gotten to those discussions yet, but I'd imagine that's going to be the next thing that's going to start to rise to the top," Richardson said. The Superdome sustained damage to its roof and some flooding. More than that, there's been no timetable for when the deluged city will reopen, let alone for the hotels and restaurants to be back in service. "We're hoping it will be there (in New Orleans), but it doesn't look as if it will be," Grambling Athletic Director Willie Jeffries said. With trying to stage rescue efforts, clean up campus damage, re-work the academic calendar for this semester and figure out what to do with Southern University-New Orleans students, the Southern administration has had little time to focus on the Bayou Classic. But that discussion is coming. "Nobody's said anything, but I am thinking about it," said SU Athletic Director Greg LaFleur, who is, like Jeffries, in his first year on the job. "After this week, when things start to subside, we're going to have to start looking at that." Richardson said the Bayou Classic, which drew 68,911 last season, is too big to be played on either campus. "To me, that's out of the issue, because of the economics and scale involved," Richardson said. "You're talking about 50-60,000 people. We couldn't handle that here. It wouldn't be on campus, our campus or their campus. With security and logistics, there are too many problems." Richardson said playing at an indoors stadium would be preferable. That would leave Reliant Stadium in Houston and the Georgia Dome in Atlanta as the closest alternatives. "I think the people want to play inside, especially at that time of year. That would be a priority in making an assessment," Richardson said. "What's available and what you had access to would be the determining factors in what direction we could go." Reliant has a natural-grass surface, and the Houston Texans play there, against the St. Louis Rams, on Nov. 27. A concern could be playing the Classic on that Saturday could damage the surface for the Sunday game. The Georgia Dome, with an artificial surface, is free that weekend, with the Atlanta Falcons playing at the Detroit Lions on Thansgiving. SMG, based in Philadelphia, manages both the Astrodome and Reliant Stadium as well as three other NFL venues. "I'm quite sure, with the economic impact the game has on this state, that they're going to do everything possible to keep the game in state," Richardson said. As far as the immediate future, SU plays at Mississippi Valley State on Sept. 10 in Itta Bena, Miss. But Richardson said he's concerned about hotel availability for his team and the program's sizable fan base. "The more you look at it, the more problems we're going to have logistically, whether we'll have a place to stay once we go up there," Richardson said. "Those people in Mississippi had to go somewhere." SU's scheduled home opener is Sept. 17 against Prairie View, with another home game, against Albany State, Sept. 24. "Those teams coming in have to address the problem," Richardson said. "Coming into town here, even though you've booked, whether you're going to be able to get in because of the accessibility of what's been happening. That's going to be another factor we'll have to deal with." After that, the Jaguars play Alabama State on Oct. 1 in storm-blasted Mobile, Ala. Also, Southern's women's volleyball team, scheduled to fly out of New Orleans early this morning, instead was scheduled to bus early today to Shreveport to catch a flight to play in a tournament at Hampton University in Virginia. The SU women's soccer team will host Alcorn State on Friday at Clark Park in Baker and then play at McNeese State on Sunday. Grambling-Alcorn in limbo Grambling's football game at Alcorn State is in limbo. Jeffries said the game has been rescheduled to Sunday, with a kickoff time yet to be determined. But Alcorn has yet to confirm any change. Alcorn's campus, near Lorman, Miss., has been without power since the storm struck. "There are many more things far more important than football," Jeffries said. "It's terrible all around."

No checks. Champps Americana is one of the new kids on the Corporate Boulevard block. Nestled among upscale shops and eateries, Champps seems to be aimed at several markets, including the lunch, dinner and late-night crowds. Atmosphere goes a long way, and Champps won't have any problem there. The open floor plan features several dining areas, a comfortable bar and at least a dozen televisions broadcasting a wide range of shows. (And of course, the big-screen TV in the main dining room is always tuned to the sports event of the day.) But the chefs have their work cut out for them. While some of the dishes are good, others are just average with very little seasoning or flavor. The sampler platter ($13.49) features four popular appetizers -- mozzarella sticks, chicken fingers, buffalo wings, cheese quesadillas and celery sticks. By far, the best sampler items are the buffalo wings, which are meaty and full of spicy flavor. The platter is served with several sauces, including a ranch dip, marinara, honey mustard and blue cheese. This one is a good choice, especially if you're having trouble committing to one particular entr?e. The barbecue chicken sandwich ($8.99) was good, but not outstanding. It's charbroiled and topped with cheddar cheese, smoked bacon strips and barbecue sauce. It was served with waffle fries that, on the night we visited, seemed on the dry side. The lemon garlic chicken ($10.99) was much better. The chicken is tender and tasty, and the garlic mashed potatoes are delicious. The lemony flavor isn't overpowering either. This is a good choice for diners with a smaller appetite. The baby back ribs ($13.99 half/$18.99) are slow-cooked and smothered in a special barbecue sauce that gives them a distinct flavor. This was one of the better dishes we tried. The accompanying cole slaw and waffle fries were just average. Finally, the Champps Americana chopped salad ($7.99/$8.99 with chicken) was a real treat. This is a meal in itself, and features lettuce, tomato, cranberries, bacon and bits of blue cheese, all smothered with a tangy vinaigrette dressing. The blue cheese crumbles either weren't real blue cheese or had simply lost their flavor ? but the end result was still satisfying. Desserts include Champps' triple chocolate cake, New York cheesecake with berries, mile-high ice cream pie and other sweets. Our waiter was helpful and friendly even though the restaurant was packed with people when we arrived. Printer Friendly Version Send this story to a friend Advertisements FEATURES

434	 Movies Home Movie Listings Trailers and release dates Archives About us Coming soon: Kevin takes a look at Underclassman The Big Show The Constant Gardener Greed, corruption and murder conspire to make The Constant Gardener an unusually intelligent thriller. Ralph Fiennes gives an affecting performance as Justin Quayle, a British diplomat who marries Tessa, a passionate social activist played by the ideally cast Rachel Weisz. The two meet when he gives a boring lecture, after which she very publicly knocks Britain's participation in the Iraqi War. John Wirt's review More movie reviews The Transporter 2 The trailer to "The Transporter 2" features exotic cars racing through the streets, highly choreographed fight scenes, and even a half-naked girl with entirely too much mascara. Kevin's review The Cave Every once in a while a movie comes along that makes you ask, "Why did they even bother?" Well, one such movie - "The Cave" - dives into theatres this week. Just remember this: taking the plunge for yourself is optional. Brett's review John Wirt's review The Brothers Grimm Considering what an enchanted mess The Brothers Grimm is, it's sort of magical how interesting director Terry Gilliam's latest film is. To begin with, the movie's heroes are rascals. Brothers Will and Jake Grimm earn big rewards for conning superstitious peasant villages out of what little money they have. John Wirt's review Undiscovered Unimaginative dialogue? Check. Uninspired acting? Check. Uncompleted subplots? Check. "Undiscovered" has a lot of things working against it, but thankfully, it also has a few redeeming qualities. Ellen's review Yes Joan Allen, the best actress in movies these days, portrays the troubled leading lady of Yes. In this intimate, impressionistic drama, Allen's renowned American biologist feels trapped in a loveless marriage to a British politician played by Sam Neil. John Wirt's review Red Eye Wow! Wow! Wow! I can say this 10 more times and still not accurately explain how good "Red Eye" is. This Wes Craven thriller could be one of his best films in years. Kevin's review John Wirt's review The 40-Year-Old Virgin I had been looking forward to seeing "The 40-Year-Old Virgin" since I saw the first trailer a couple of weeks ago. Steve Carell was great in "Anchorman" and "Bruce Almighty" and I was anxious to see how he would perform in this film's lead role. Ellen's review John Wirt's review Valiant In this World War II-set kids film, British pigeons carry secret messages in the fight against the Nazis. When a young wood pigeon named Valiant sees a newsreel about the winged heroes of the Royal Homing Pigeon Service, he decides to enlist. John Wirt's review Photo Gallery Some gems may be found during slow season for movies The months between the big summer movie season and the blockbuster holiday movie season are the dog days at the multiplex. Hollywood studios typically fill screens with movies for which they have low expectations. Mega-hits will likely be scarce until November, when the Thanksgiving holiday marks the starting line for holiday movie-going. On the positive side, the less competitive fall often sees more serious, thoughtful and artistically ambitious films. The Constant Gardener, a romantic thriller based on the best-selling book by John Le Carr? and directed by the Oscar-nominated Fernando Meirelles (City of God), opens this week There's also Roman Polanski's adaptation of the Charles Dickens classic, Oliver Twist, arriving Sept. 30, and the fanciful stop-motion animated feature, Tim Burton's Corpse Bride, opening Sept. 23, as is Roll Bounce, an urban drama-comedy that could be this year's Soul Food. Read the story 'Kung Fu Hustle' director plans sequel Hong Kong comic actor and director Stephen Chow said Tuesday he'll start filming the sequel to his action film "Kung Fu Hustle" either late this year or early 2006. Chow called the movie's $17.1 million box office take in America as of Aug. 18 "not bad," but said, "I hope I can do better in the future." Chow said casting for the "Kung Fu Hustle" sequel hasn't been finalized and that he hasn't settled on a female lead. Read the story Disagree with us?

Williams scooped up a Lafayette fumble forced by strong safety Josh Jordan and sprinted 78 yards to the end zone to give Breaux Bridge a 27-20 win in the season opener for both squads.

The voice is mute and stilled the heart That loved us well and true, Ah, bitter was the trial to part From one so good as you. You are not forgotten loved one Nor will you ever be As long as life and memory last We will remember thee. We miss you now, our hearts are sore, As time goes by we miss you more, Your loving smile, your gentle face, No one can fill your vacant place.   23rd Psalm The Lord is my shepherd: I shall not want.  He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul:  he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.  Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil:  for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me. Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.  Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life:  and I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever.

645	Server: Sun-ONE-Web-Server/6.1 Date: Sun, 04 Sep 2005 00:02:52 GMT Content-type: text/html Connection: close U.S. Senator Thad Cochran - Biography   BIOGRAPHY Thad Cochran was born December 7, 1937, in Pontotoc, Mississippi. His father, William Holmes Cochran, was the principal and his mother, Emma Grace Cochran, was a teacher in schools in Pontotoc and Tippah County. Summers were spent by the family, which included Thad's younger brother, Nielsen, on the campuses at the University of Mississippi, where their parents would earn Masters degrees, and at Blue Mountain College, where they were members of the faculty. In 1946, the Cochrans moved to the Byram community of Hinds County near Jackson. There was much time devoted to sports, music, the Boy Scouts, and church activities. Thad became an Eagle Scout and helped establish a new scout troop at Spring Ridge Methodist Church. He served as its ï¬ rst Junior Assistant Scout Master. At Byram high school, Thad earned varsity letters in football, basketball, baseball, and tennis. He gave a piano and voice recital his senior year and was class valedictorian. He was also a member of the 4-H Club and Daniel Memorial Baptist Church. During junior and senior high school, Thad worked in a variety of after school and weekend jobs. His ï¬rst regular job was at Gunn's Dairy Bar where he was a âcar hop.â He clerked at Nicholson's Grocery store, cleared right-of-way for Deviney Construction Company, and helped his father and brother on the family's cattle farm near Utica. In 1955, Thad enrolled in the school of liberal arts at the University of Mississippi. He earned a B.A. degree with a major in psychology and a minor in political science. He was elected President of his social fraternity, Pi Kappa Alpha, was a company commander in the Navy ROTC, Vice President of the Student Body, and was selected for membership in Omicron Delta Kappa, national honorary leadership fraternity. During the summers, he worked as a life guard at Livingston Lake in Jackson. When he graduated from Ole Miss in 1959, he was commissioned an Ensign in the U.S. Naval Reserve and assigned to duty aboard a heavy cruiser, the USS MACON, which was homeported in Boston, Massachusetts. He served on this ship for 18 months becoming the ship's legal ofï¬cer after graduating as an honor student from the U.S. Navy School of Justice in Newport, Rhode Island. He also became qualiï¬ed as Ofï¬cer of the Deck, in port and underway. When his ship was decommissioned in January 1961, he was assigned to the staff of the Commandant of the Eighth Naval District in New Orleans, Louisiana, to complete his two year tour of active duty in the Navy. In the fall of 1961, he enrolled in the School of Law at the University of Mississippi. At the Ole Miss law school he won the Frederick Hamel Memorial Award for having the highest scholastic average in the ï¬rst year class. He was selected for membership in Phi Delta Phi, honorary legal fraternity; served on the editorial board of the Mississippi Law Journal; argued before the Mississippi Supreme Court as a moot court ï¬nalist; and was elected Chairman of the Honor Council. Before graduating from law school, he was awarded a Rotary Foundation Graduate Fellowship and studied jurisprudence and international law for a year at Trinity College, University of Dublin, Ireland. During this year abroad, Thad spoke to numerous Rotary Clubs and other groups in Ireland on the subject of the civil rights struggle in Mississippi and the United States. He also won the Hillary Term Moot Court competition sponsored by the Dublin Law Society. On June 6, 1964, he was married at the First Methodist Church in New Albany, Mississippi, to Rose Clayton, who had graduated from the University of Mississippi in 1963. During his last year of law school at Ole Miss, he served as Article Editor of the Mississippi Law Journal and was selected for membership in Phi Kappa Phi, national honorary scholastic fraternity. Several years later when he delivered the graduation address at the law school, Dean Parham Williams observed that Thad Cochran's law school grade point average was the third highest of all students who had graduated from the Ole Miss law school during the decade of the 1960's. During the summer vacation months in the law school years of 1962, '63, and '64, Thad returned to active duty in the Navy and taught military law and naval orientation at the Ofï¬cer Candidate School in Newport, Rhode Island. He was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant in the U.S. Naval Reserve. After graduating from law school, he joined the ï¬rm of Watkins & Eager in Jackson, one of the state's most respected law ï¬rms. He was made a partner in the ï¬rm in only two and one-half years. He served as President of the Jackson Men's Y Club, member of the Board of the Jackson Rotary Club, and member of the Board of Mississippi Opera, Inc. Thad organized the ï¬rst Mississippi chapter of the American Field Service and served as charter President to sponsor foreign exchange programs for high school students. He was Chairman of the Legal Services program of the Jackson Junior Bar, Chairman of the Mississippi Law Institute, a continuing legal education program for Mississippi lawyers, and in 1971 he was elected President of the Young Lawyers Division of the Mississippi Bar Association. He was also named that year by the Jaycees as Jackson's Young Man of the Year and as one of the Three Outstanding Young Men of the Year in Mississippi. Politics and government were subjects of much interest in the Cochran family. As early as 1951, Thad accompanied his mother as she drove through her hometown of Utica, and helped deliver door to door a campaign tabloid for the Paul B. Johnson, Jr. campaign for Governor. His father was a surrogate in the campaigns of Felder Dearman for Highway Commissioner and Jack Tubb for State Superintendent of Education. Thad often traveled with his father and helped with voter registration for these campaigns. Later, Thad Cochran became active in other political campaigns on his own. He appeared on television for the ï¬rst time to endorse Fred Thomas for Sheriff of Hinds County in 1967. He was Hinds County Chairman in Brad Dye's successful race for State Treasurer, and he wrote talking points and issue briefs for Charles Sullivan's campaign for Governor in 1971. The Presidential campaign of 1968 marked the ï¬rst time he became involved in a political campaign for a Republican candidate when he served as Executive Director of Mississippi Citizens for Nixon-Agnew. Four years later, Thad Cochran was elected United States Congressman for the Fourth District which included twelve counties in southwest Mississippi. He was appointed to the Public Works and Transportation Committee, which had jurisdiction over economic development, transportation, and ï¬ ood control. He also served on a Republican task force to study the energy crisis, and he contributed to the writing of a report that was published in book form by the House Republican Conference. He was appointed later to the Committee on Standards of Ofï¬cial Conduct and the Select Committee on Ethics which wrote a new ethics code for Members of Congress. After winning re-election to the House in 1974, he was elected by his colleagues to represent the southern states on the House Republican Policy Committee. He was re-elected to the House of Representatives again in 1976. In both of his races for re-election, Cochran received over 70 percent of the votes. In 1978, Thad Cochran was elected to the United States Senate becoming the ï¬rst Republican in over 100 years to win a statewide election in Mississippi. He was re-elected in 1984 in a race with Governor William Winter with over 60 percent of the votes. In 1990 he was unopposed, and in 1996 he was re-elected to a fourth term in the Senate with over 70 percent of the votes. His margin of victory in the 2002 election was 85 percent. Senator Cochran has served as Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, the Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee and the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee. He currently serves as Chairman of the full Appropriations Committee and as a member of the Rules Committee. His legislative record includes the sponsorship of the National Missile Defense Act of 1999, the Campaign Finance Reform Act, as well as, key provisions of several farm bills. Senator Cochran has also written legislation supporting education programs such as teacher training, vocational education, libraries, and educational television. He served as a member of the National Education Goals Panel. Numerous university based research projects have been funded with Senator Cochran's assistance including energy, agriculture, and forestry facilities at Mississippi State University, the Polymer Science Center at the University of Southern Mississippi, the Natural Products Center, Water and Wetlands Center, and Food Service Management Institute at the University of Mississippi, the National Warmwater Aquaculture Research Center at Stoneville, and the Jackson Heart Study by Jackson State University and the University of Mississippi Medical Center. He authored the Mississippi Wilderness Act which is the ï¬rst federal legislation ever passed for the perpetual protection of lands in the State of Mississippi. He also helped establish national wildlife refuges as a member of the Migratory Bird Conservation Commission, and he authored the Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program. In 1994, he was named by Ducks Unlimited as Conservationist of the Year in Mississippi. He was named Conservationist of the Year in 1996 by the North American Waterfowl Federation and received the Conservation Achievement Award from the National Wildlife Federation. He has received the lifetime achievement award of The Nature Conservancy. He has helped develop, maintain, and improve the Natchez Trace Parkway, the Natchez Historical Park, the Vicksburg National Military Park and the Gulf Islands National Seashore. As a member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, he has worked successfully to support the Navy's shipbuilding programs and the military bases and installations in Mississippi. Senator Cochran has served on the Board of Visitors of the Air Force Academy and as Chairman of the Board at the Military Academy at West Point. He is now a member of the Board of the U.S. Naval Academy. During previous Congresses, Cochran served on the Senate Ethics Committee, the Judiciary Committee, the Labor and Human Resources Committee, and the Committee on Indian Affairs. Service on these committees has enabled him to be actively involved in the writing of laws affecting a wide range of issues including rural development, health care, and criminal law. Senator Cochran has been awarded honorary degrees from Kentucky Wesleyan College, Mississippi College, Blue Mountain College, and the University of Richmond. He is a Member of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution and the Board of the Museum of American History. He is a member of Northminster Baptist Church in Jackson, Mississippi. He and his wife, the former Rose Clayton of New Albany, Mississippi, have two grown children and two grandsons.    Home | Biography | Press Releases | Legislation | Offices CommitteesContact Me | Services | Audio Clips | Video Clips | Mississippi

The Secure Handling of Ammonium Nitrate Act requires parties who produce, store, sell, or distribute ammonium nitrate to register their facility with their state department of agriculture and to maintain records of sales and distribution of the product. Senator Cochran said, "The continued availability of ammonium nitrate fertilizer to U.S. farmers has economic, agronomic, and environmental benefits not only to farmers but also to society as a whole. This bill will provide necessary precautions for misuse of the product, but will not unduly burden agriculture professionals or farmers who rely on it." Ammonium nitrate fertilizer was used in the 1995 terrorist attack on the Oklahoma City Federal Building. Following that tragedy, Congress passed legislation calling for a study on the feasibility and practicability of imposing controls on certain precursor chemicals, including ammonium nitrate. The bill introduced today is a reflection of the cooperation between the Department of Homeland Security, the agriculture community, and the fertilizer industry. "I believe this important legislation will effectively enhance ongoing security measures and will help to keep ammonium nitrate out of the hands of those who wish to harm our nation," Cochran said. Senators Pryor, Chambliss, and Roberts were original cosponsors of the legislation. ### <! ---------- Press Release / Speech Goes Above --------- >   Home | Biography | Press Releases | Legislation | Offices | CommitteesContact Me | Services | Audio Clips | Video Clips | Mississippi

Senator Thad Cochran (R-MS) announced his support today for Majority Leader Frist's plan to end filibusters in blocking judicial nominees. Senator Cochran offered the following statement Thursday morning to the Senate regarding the use of filibusters to block judicial nominees: "The continued controversy over Senate confirmation of federal judges needs to be resolved. It promises to hang as a cloud over the Senate unless we reach an understanding of the appropriate role of the Senate. "I had been hopeful that the Senate leadership would be able to resolve this issue by reaching an agreement that would be acceptable to both sides. However, that does not now appear likely. "Therefore, I have advised the distinguished Majority Leader, Mr. Frist, that I will support him in his effort to bring this confrontation over judicial filibusters to an end. "There should be no question in anyone's mind about my intentions. I will work in concert with our leader, and with the distinguished Majority Whip, Mr. McConnell, to end filibusters of judicial nominations in the Senate." ### <! ---------- Press Release / Speech Goes Above --------- >   Home | Biography | Press Releases | Legislation | Offices | CommitteesContact Me | Services | Audio Clips | Video Clips | Mississippi

The operations in Iraq are very impressive in terms of the safety and security that we are now seeing in the wake of the elections that were held there. The turnout of people was really quite phenomenal and I think speaks very strongly in support of the policies that the President has followed there to bring freedom and democracy to that country. I think the funding he requests is going to be something we have to carefully consider. We do want to hold the line on unnecessary spending. We have a deficit problem. We need to control spending, as he points out. I think he is going to submit a very tough budget to the Congress. We have an obligation though to help ensure that the operations in Iraq are brought to a conclusion successfully, and I think supporting the President in his efforts to maintain the peace here at home and protect our security are very important indeed. I'm going to help him try to save Social Security. I think that is a very important part of his message tonight. We have an opportunity, but we have an obligation to senior citizens and to the younger people who are entering the workforce today to help ensure that they are going to be able to trust the government to have a workable program that benefits them as well." ### <! ---------- Press Release / Speech Goes Above --------- >   Home | Biography | Press Releases | Legislation | Offices | CommitteesContact Me | Services | Audio Clips | Video Clips | Mississippi

Three of these vessels will be homeported at Naval Station Pascagoula, helping to enhance homeland security and secure NS Pascagoula's place in America's defense structure, Senators Thad Cochran and Trent Lott announced today. Naval Station Pascagoula will homeport the USCGC Tempest, Shamal and Toronado. San Diego will homeport the other two newly acquired PC-179 ships. The decision brings the total number of cutters stationed in Pascagoula to four. Senator Cochran said, "The joint operation between Navy Station Pascagoula and the Coast Guard has proven to be very beneficial. I am pleased that Pascagoula has been chosen as the port to base three of the nation's most important homeland security cutters. This decision creates new opportunities for the Coast Guard in the Mississippi Gulf Coast, and will enhance the economic development of the area." Senator Lott said, "This decision will significantly enhance the Coast Guard's homeland security capabilities in the very important Gulf Region, helping to protect key facilities like Northrop Grumman Ship Systems, the Chevron Refinery and other assets vital to our nation's security," Senator Lott said. "The cutters will also add to the Homeport's status as a multi-mission base, which would have positive implications in the anticipated 2005 base closure round." The five 180-foot vessels are among 13 patrol craft which belong to the Navy's Special Operations Command. They have directly supported Coast Guard Homeland Security operations since November 2001, working jointly with the Coast Guard to help protect our nation's coastline, ports, and waterways, and operating under Coast Guard tactical control. <! ---------- Press Release / Speech Goes Above --------- >   Home | Biography | Press Releases | Legislation | Offices | CommitteesContact Me | Services | Audio Clips | Video Clips | Mississippi

"This legislation focuses attention and resources on people and areas of the country where the needs are the greatest. I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this bill," said Cochran. The bill is likely the most comprehensive national initiative ever proposed to address disparities in health care. It would expand access to health care through an access grant program to strengthen state uninsured and Medicaid programs, and it formally authorizes and expands the Office of Minority Health and Health Disparities at the Department of Health and Human Services. The legislation also develops a comprehensive system of health care data collection, focused on the under-served populations. It increases health care education programs, especially those at Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and it increases funding for research at the NIH and other HHS agencies. The bill has now been referred to the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, where it is awaiting consideration. ### <! ---------- Press Release / Speech Goes Above --------- >   Home | Biography | Press Releases | Legislation | Offices | CommitteesContact Me | Services | Audio Clips | Video Clips | Mississippi

These are very real challenges. The economy is moving along in the right direction now, and I think the President should be given the credit for assuming the burden of leadership to help establish a tax policy that stimulates investment and savings and rewards businesses and encourages Americans to work hard to help make sure our country is moving along in the right direction economically. We have achieved a great deal in that area. I think in national security, the war in Iraq is troublesome and a difficult challenge, but our troops and the military leaders we have are managing that situation, although it continues to be very risky and very dangerous. I think we are going to come out of it with a safer world, with less likelihood of terrorism coming from that region to our shores. And that is the point -- to make sure we safeguard American lives and safeguard our country. The President is providing strong leadership in that regard, and I am going to continue to support him." ### <! ---------- Press Release / Speech Goes Above --------- >   Home | Biography | Press Releases | Legislation | Offices | CommitteesContact Me | Services | Audio Clips | Video Clips | Mississippi

"Strokes are debilitating and deadly. Mississippi has one of the highest rates of death due to stroke in the nation," said Senator Cochran. "This bill invests in prevention and early treatment that will reduce disability and increase survival rate." The bill provides grants to states to develop statewide programs for stroke care, so that the most effective treatment will be available to patients as quickly and efficiently as possible to reduce the level of disability caused by stroke. "All of us in the health professions appreciate the interest and support of Sen. Cochran and his colleagues. We look forward to providing better care for our patients with stroke, and more opportunities to prevent stroke," said University of Mississippi Medical Center Vice Chancellor Dan Jones. In the STOP Stroke Act, training will be available for health professionals, as will guidelines on best practices. Stroke systems will rely on information-sharing among agencies and individuals involved in the study and provision of care. The bill also authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Paul Coverdell National Acute Stroke Registry to enhance the development and collection of data and analyze the care of acute stroke patients. In the 107th Congress, the STOP Stroke Act passed the Senate unanimously. Congressman Chip Pickering (R-MS) has also introduced similar stroke legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives. ### <! ---------- Press Release / Speech Goes Above --------- >   Home | Biography | Press Releases | Legislation | Offices | CommitteesContact Me | Services | Audio Clips | Video Clips | Mississippi

He is really not anxious to get us into a war, but he realizes that there are serious threats in the world today ? Iraq with weapons of mass destruction and other countries that are capable of developing weapons of mass destruction. We have to make sure that we are a force for peace and stability in the world, and that we're prepared to defend freedom and the security of the American people. So, I'm pleased with the way he handled that issue and spelled out the facts for the American people and for the world. Also, I'm pleased that he is taking an aggressive stance on the economy ? telling us the steps that are necessary to get our economy growing again, and to try to control federal spending as a part of that. Also, to create some tax incentives, so that people will save and invest, that businesses can start and flourish, so we can create the jobs that the American people need. On the subject of health care, I was pleased to hear about his ideas for modernizing Medicare, including a prescription drug benefit. I think that is important. And so is encouraging compassion in our communities, by providing incentives for faith-based initiatives to help people who are down on their luck who need the help of the community. These are things that I think were the highlights as far as I'm concerned, and I think the President is showing strong leadership." ### <! ---------- Press Release / Speech Goes Above --------- >   Home | Biography | Press Releases | Legislation | Offices | CommitteesContact Me | Services | Audio Clips | Video Clips | Mississippi

Shipman would transition to the Agriculture Committee once Senator Cochran has officially assumed his duties as Chairman when the 108th Congress convenes in January. While serving as USDA's Deputy Undersecretary for Farm and Foreign Agricultural Services, Shipman provided leadership to various agencies within the agency. In this position, he managed various programs administered by the Farm Service Agency and the Commodity Credit Corporation, the Risk Management Agency and the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation, and the Foreign Agricultural Service. These agencies are comprised of more than 18,000 employees and administer more than $34 billion in USDA programs. Shipman also served as an advisor to Secretary Veneman during the Bush Administration transition, helped lead USDA's 2002 Farm Bill Implementation team, and was instrumental in developing various Bush Administration farm policy initiatives. Prior to his position at the Department of Agriculture, Shipman served on Senator Cochran's staff from June 1992 until January 2001, first as a legislative aide, then as the Senator's legislative assistant handling agricultural issues, including agriculture appropriations. Cochran said, "I am pleased Hunt Shipman will return to my staff to be the new staff director of the Agriculture Committee. Hunt worked tirelessly on the recent farm bill as a member of Secretary Veneman's team. I know he will do a superb job of managing the work of the committee staff." "This is a tremendous opportunity for Hunt, and I strongly support his decision to again work for Senator Cochran in this new capacity. Hunt's leadership, as well as his extensive knowledge and understanding of trade and agricultural issues, will be sorely missed at USDA," said Agriculture Secretary Ann M. Veneman. "Hunt has been an effective, trusted and dedicated public servant, helping guide us during the Administration's transition period and helping lead USDA's Farm Bill implementation team. We all wish him the very best and look forward to working closely with him in his new position." ### <! ---------- Press Release / Speech Goes Above --------- >   Home | Biography | Press Releases | Legislation | Offices | CommitteesContact Me | Services | Audio Clips | Video Clips | Mississippi

Senator Cochran made a motion to approve $533,000 to fund the acquisition of an additional 600 acres for the Grand Bay Refuge, which the Commission approved. In April 2000, The Conservation Fund, which is made up of partnering organizations, acquired a 2,100 acre tract of land valued at $3.8 million. This land was donated to The Conservation Fund by the International Paper Company. These recent acquisitions for the Grand Bay National Wildlife Refuge are valued at over $4.3 million. This investment is important for the continued protection, restoration, and management of the undeveloped hardwood and pine wetland ecosystem of the Gulf Coast region which provides a palustrine habitat for migratory birds. The Grand Bay Refuge is especially important to trans-gulf birds who use it as a resting/staging point before they continue to migrate north or south. This land also supports an important variety of waterfowl species, including pintail, mallard, mottled duck, scaup, wood duck, redhead, canvasback and widgeon. Cochran said, "I am pleased that the Migratory Bird Conservation Commission is continuing to protect this valuable natural refuge in our State. The wildlife refuge system, along with continued conservation practices on privately owned land, will help ensure an abundance of waterfowl." The Migratory Bird Conservation Commission, created in 1934, approves the acquisition of migratory bird habitats recommended by the Secretary of the Interior. The Commission is chaired by the Secretary of the Interior, and membership includes the Secretary of Agriculture, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, two Members of Congress, and two U.S. Senators. Senator Cochran has served on the Commission since 1981. ### <! ---------- Press Release / Speech Goes Above --------- >   Home | Biography | Press Releases | Legislation | Offices | CommitteesContact Me | Services | Audio Clips | Video Clips | Mississippi

Deer Island will be included in Mississippi's Coastal Preserve System. As a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senator Cochran was successful in having this funding added to the Fiscal Year 2002 Commerce, Justice, State, and the Judiciary Appropriations bill. The funds will be used in conjunction with state matching funds to purchase Deer Island which will create a state-operated recreational and scenic preserve. Senator Cochran said, "I am pleased that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has released the funding to help the State of Mississippi acquire Deer Island. This will ensure the continued preservation of this area on the Mississippi Gulf Coast." The funding was provided through NOAA's Coastal and Estuarine Land Conservation Program. This program is intended to protect those coastal and estuarine areas with significant conservation, recreation, ecological, or historical value, or those that are threatened by conversion from their natural state to other uses. ### <! ---------- Press Release / Speech Goes Above --------- >   Home | Biography | Press Releases | Legislation | Offices | CommitteesContact Me | Services | Audio Clips | Video Clips | Mississippi

The U.S. Department of Commerce has decided to impose a combined 29.01 % duty on imported Canadian lumber to offset unfair trade practices, Senator Thad Cochran (R-MS) announced today. In its final ruling, the Department set the duty at 19.34 % to countervail subsidies and at 9.67 % to compensate for dumping lumber in the U.S. market. Senator Cochran said, "I'm pleased that the Department of Commerce and the U.S. Trade Representative have decided to impose duties on Canadian lumber imports. This action will help domestic lumber mills who have experienced tough times due to plummeting lumber prices." Last April, the U.S. softwood lumber industry filed two cases following the expiration of the U.S.-Canadian Softwood Lumber Agreement. The first was an antidumping case alleging imports were being sold in the U.S. at less than fair value, and the second was a countervailing duty case alleging that subsidized imports were having an injurious effect on domestic lumber mills. The International Trade Commission will conduct hearings next week to determine whether Canada's subsidies and the dumping of their lumber have caused injury to the U.S. lumber industry. "The decision of the ITC will affect thousands of workers in Mississippi. The strictest application of the law is needed to stop mill closures, lost jobs, lost sales, and the flood of Canadian lumber," Cochran said. At this time, the Department of Commerce has ceased all negotiations with Canada on this trade issue. Cochran said, "I am disappointed that the U.S. and Canada have been unable to negotiate a free and fair trade agreement on this important agricultural commodity. I hope that our two countries can work out a long-term resolution soon." ### <! ---------- Press Release / Speech Goes Above --------- >   Home | Biography | Press Releases | Legislation | Offices | CommitteesContact Me | Services | Audio Clips | Video Clips | Mississippi

Harrison County will receive a grant totaling $1,078,595 from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to either acquire or elevate 14 area homes that have been repetitively damaged by flood waters, Senators Thad Cochran and Trent Lott announced today. The funds will pay for 13 homes to be elevated and one property to be acquired and demolished. All property owners must voluntarily agree to participate in the program. The structures are located in the flood plains of Tuxachanie Creek, Tchouchabouffa River, and its tributaries. This process will allow floodwaters to flow unimpeded through the area, preventing back-ups that might also threaten other adjoining neighborhoods. Cochran said, "This project will provide important relief for Harrison County residents who have battled floods and sustained flood damage time after time." "Controlling flood waters has always been a very important issue to Mississippians, and I am pleased that the Bush Administration has approved this expenditure for our state," Senator Lott said. "This funding will help promote enhanced public safety and minimize the risk to property and lives in this area." Total project costs for this program are $1,154,295. Harrison County and local homeowners will pay the remaining $75,700 that is not covered by the FEMA grant. The funds for this project come from FEMA's Hazard Mitigation Grant Program. ### <! ---------- Press Release / Speech Goes Above --------- >   Home | Biography | Press Releases | Legislation | Offices | CommitteesContact Me | Services | Audio Clips | Video Clips | Mississippi

President George W. Bush has declared a major disaster for the State of Mississippi making families and individuals eligible for federal emergency assistance in those counties that were struck by the severe storms and tornadoes on November 24 and 25, Senators Thad Cochran and Trent Lott announced today. The federal disaster declaration directs the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to supplement state and local recovery efforts in the damaged areas by providing federal assistance to those families and individuals who suffered loss of life, injury and devastating property damage. Mississippi counties designated to receive assistance include: Bolivar, DeSoto, Hinds, Humphreys, Madison, Panola, Quitman, Sunflower, Tate and Washington. All counties are eligible to apply for hazard mitigation assistance under the Hazard Mitigation Grant program, which helps State and local governments take action to prevent or reduce long term risk to life and property from natural or technological hazards. Joe M. Allbaugh, Director of FEMA, named Gracia Szczech to be the Federal Coordinating Officer for recovery operations in the affected area. The Agency continues to survey damaged areas, and additional assistance and counties may be added after the assessments are completed. Cochran said, "I am pleased the President has approved this emergency assistance so that Mississippians who have suffered loss due to these storms can begin recovering and rebuilding as quickly as possible." "I am delighted that President Bush has acted to provide this much needed assistance to Mississippians impacted by recent severe weather," Senator Lott said. "Mississippi has been hit especially hard by a variety of natural disasters in recent months, and each time the President has graciously acted to provide help to Mississippians. Though no amount of money can replace the loss of life, this funding is welcome news as our communities continue the recovery effort." ### <! ---------- Press Release / Speech Goes Above --------- >   Home | Biography | Press Releases | Legislation | Offices | CommitteesContact Me | Services | Audio Clips | Video Clips | Mississippi

U.S. Senator Thad Cochran (R-MS) voiced his support for Bill Hawks of Hernando, Mississippi, who has been nominated by President Bush to be Undersecretary of Agricultural Marketing and Regulatory Programs at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Following are the Senators remarks made today during Hawks confirmation hearing of the Agriculture Committee: "I'm pleased to be here this morning to welcome my good friend and fellow Mississippian, Bill Hawks, and Mr. Bost as well. We are very fortunate, I think to have the Secretary of Agriculture and the Administration selecting such outstanding people to serve in this Administration particularly at the Department of Agriculture. I think the operation and administration of that Department is going to be in very good hands indeed. I've known Bill Hawks for a long time. He has been a leader in our state, not only in agriculture where he has served on the state Farm Service Agency Committee and at the local level in positions of responsibility, but also in our state government as a very well-respected member of our state Senate. He was a leader there, and he's looked to for leadership in our state on a wide range of issues and subjects. He's very well-respected. He was an outstanding student at Mississippi State University where he earned Bachelor and Masters degrees. He's taken an active role in the political life of our state and our nation. He's been a leader of farm groups in Presidential election campaigns, and he is someone who is very civic-minded and gives a lot of his time and effort to helping make our state a better place to live and the country as well. So, I think we are fortunate to have him serving in this position. I'm confident that he'll be well-received by our Committee, because of his experience, his good judgement and his past performance in everything he's ever undertaken. And, on top of all that, he's a farmer. He really knows what he's going to be doing. He knows something about the subject from first hand experience. He and his wife, Diane, who's an active partner in the farming operation, have several thousand acres of land that they farm in DeSoto County Mississippi, just south of Memphis. He's been very successful. Even when times are tough he figures out a way to manage - kind of like our Chairman. You can talk with each other and explain it to everyone else. It's a pleasure for me to welcome Bill and wish him well in this new undertaking." ### <! ---------- Press Release / Speech Goes Above --------- >   Home | Biography | Press Releases | Legislation | Offices | CommitteesContact Me | Services | Audio Clips | Video Clips | Mississippi

The President also proposes a ten-year contingency reserve which could provide additional assistance to farmers if needed. The Senator commended the Department for making the implementation of emergency assistance programs a high priority and for working to promulgate regulations and disperse funds to producers. Cochran said, "This Committee looks forward to working with the Department on these and other efforts to help farmers and to strengthen the U.S. farm economy."

Secretary of Agriculture Ann Veneman testified at the hearing. Cochran urged Secretary Veneman "to monitor closely the problems being faced by producers of food and agriculture commodities and to request full funding for assistance that may be needed to deal with emergency needs of our nation's farmers." The Senator observed that the President's budget included requests for nutrition assistance programs, food safety programs, and trade initiatives that give U.S. producers access to world markets. Cochran asked about the challenges faced by the USDA to protect the U.S. against mad cow disease and foot and mouth disease. Cochran said, "These new challenges will require special efforts and vigilance to ensure that those problems don't occur in the U.S." The Secretary outlined the steps being taken to protect U.S. borders from these diseases that are creating serious problems in other parts of the world. Cochran also questioned the Secretary about disaster payments to farmers that were delayed by the previous Administration. "Last year Congress ordered disaster assistance payments be made to distressed farmers because of drought conditions and other weather-related problems that they faced. Those payments were late being dispersed, and I'd like to know if the funds that were appropriated for this purpose have been paid to the farmers who need them, or are there other problems that the Congress needs to address to deal with last year's declared emergencies," Cochran said. Secretary Veneman said that about $3.5 billion in payments have been made to those qualifying for emergency assistance, and almost all appropriated funds had been dispersed. Other witnesses at the hearing included Keith Collins, Chief Economist, Department of Agriculture, and Stephen B. Dewhurst, Budget Officer, Department of Agriculture. ### <! ---------- Press Release / Speech Goes Above --------- >   Home | Biography | Press Releases | Legislation | Offices | CommitteesContact Me | Services | Audio Clips | Video Clips | Mississippi

There were many Senators on both sides of the aisle who worked hard and effectively to achieve this result, but the credit for this victory must be given to Senators McCain and Feingold. It was their determination and perseverance that triumphed over long odds to win this battle, and I predict they will find a way to get this bill to the President's desk. No one can predict with certainty exactly how this law will work in practice. But, I think it will make the process more transparent, and candidates will have a better chance of controlling their own campaigns. And, I think the confidence of the American people in the political process will be restored." ### <! ---------- Press Release / Speech Goes Above --------- >   Home | Biography | Press Releases | Legislation | Offices | CommitteesContact Me | Services | Audio Clips | Video Clips | Mississippi

Cochran said, "Mississippi lumber producers are experiencing tough times due to high fuel prices and plummeting lumber prices. It is important that the Commerce Department act quickly to keep additional Mississippi lumber mills from closing." The purpose of the meeting was to encourage the Commerce Department to take action under existing trade laws so that the softwood lumber industry can receive relief. The softwood lumber industry will file two trade cases on April 2nd, the first business day after the Canadian agreement expires on Saturday, March 31st. The first is an antidumping case alleging imports are being sold in the U.S. at less than fair value, and the second is a countervailing duty case alleging that subsidized imports are having an injurious effect on the domestic softwood industry. The industry is concerned that Canadian imports will surge immediately after these cases are filed. The most important issue to the lumber producers in Mississippi is the timeliness of the decision that the Commerce Department must make with regard to determining the level of Canadian government subsidies. "It is clear that the industry has been injured. I am hopeful that the Commerce Department will act under existing trade laws to prohibit subsidized Canadian imports from being sold in the U.S. at less than fair market prices," Cochran said. ### <! ---------- Press Release / Speech Goes Above --------- >   Home | Biography | Press Releases | Legislation | Offices | CommitteesContact Me | Services | Audio Clips | Video Clips | Mississippi

Senator Thad Cochran (R-MS) today introduced the Lower Mississippi Delta Education Access and Improvement Act of 2001 which would help to improve the health and education of the children of the region. Cochran said, "My bill will authorize grants to institutions of higher learning located in the Lower Mississippi Delta for the improvement of education and student and teacher performance." "The character and fabric of our Nation have been significantly enhanced by the Mississippi Delta's unique blend of the talents that created blues music and Pulitzer Prize literature, but the problems facing this region overshadow the triumphs of the past," Cochran said. "These problems include below average reading skills among elementary children, lower levels of accreditation among teachers, and high levels of poverty," he added. Despite these problems Cochran noted that "there is a sense of optimism among community leaders and educators." Universities, community based organizations, and schools are developing comprehensive initiatives to achieve new success in teacher training and retention, preschool learning readiness, parental education, school-wide performance, birth to Kindergarten preventative health care and immunization delivery. Cochran said, "These are the people who best know their problems, and more importantly, how to solve them. In my opinion, these are the efforts that deserve federal support." ### <! ---------- Press Release / Speech Goes Above --------- >   Home | Biography | Press Releases | Legislation | Offices | CommitteesContact Me | Services | Audio Clips | Video Clips | Mississippi

The bill also reauthorizes MATHLINE, a proven professional development model for teachers of mathematics. Cochran initially introduced the Ready To Learn Act in 1992 after research data revealed that nearly every preschool child in America was watching up to 30 hours of television per week, yet there were very few educational shows on television. Ready To Learn built on the idea of utilizing the time these children spent in front of the television to prepare them for the first year of school. The legislation was signed into law by President Bush in October 1992. It supported the coordination of existing Public Broadcasting shows like "Sesame Street" and "Mister Rogers' Neighborhood" with new outreach efforts by local public broadcasting stations. "The Ready To Learn, Ready To Teach Act takes the best of educational technology programming; improves those proven to work, and places renewed confidence in one of education's most trusted and successful partners," Cochran said. New research from the University of Alabama and the University of Kansas reports that Ready To Learn is having a positive impact on children and their parents. "The University of Alabama study found that Ready To Learn families read books together more often and for longer periods, and these children actually watch 40 percent less television and are more likely to choose educational programs," Cochran said. "In my state, the Mississippi Educational Television Network Ready To Learn director, Cassandra Washington Love, has received high praise for the effective assistance she provides to families," Cochran added. The new Ready To Learn legislation also improves upon an already successful program called MATHLINE, which combines technology and teacher "best practices." "This bill graduates MATHLINE to TeacherLine, a more comprehensive professional development tool for teachers of preschool through twelfth grade. TeacherLine will also support state of the art, digitally produced content for classroom use," Cochran said. ### <! ---------- Press Release / Speech Goes Above --------- >   Home | Biography | Press Releases | Legislation | Offices | CommitteesContact Me | Services | Audio Clips | Video Clips | Mississippi

The U.S. Senate today adopted an amendment introduced by Senator Thad Cochran (R-MS) that would require the Federal Election Commission to post all federal election reports on the Internet. "My amendment will ensure that election related reports will be made accessible to the general public as quickly as possible. I think the American people have a right to know who is financing these political campaigns, how much they are spending, and how they are spending it," Cochran said. Under the terms of the amendment any designation, statement, report or notification that is filed with the FEC must be made accessible to the public and posted on the Internet within 48 hours of being received by the Commission. If the information is filed electronically, it must be posted on the web site within 24 hours of receipt. Cochran's amendment requires that the FEC shall maintain a central site on the Internet to make all publicly disclosed election-related reports and information accessible to the public. The amendment states that "election-related report" means any report, designation or statement required to be filed under the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971. The amendment further requires other federal executive agencies that receive election-related information to coordinate with the FEC and make the report available for posting on or through the web site in a timely manner. ### <! ---------- Press Release / Speech Goes Above --------- >   Home | Biography | Press Releases | Legislation | Offices | CommitteesContact Me | Services | Audio Clips | Video Clips | Mississippi

Senator Thad Cochran (R-MS) made the following statement in the U.S. Senate on campaign reform today: "I commend the principal sponsors of this bill, the distinguished Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, and the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. Feingold, for their leadership and for their perseverance. This day has been a long time coming, but the time has finally come for campaign finance reform. I'm pleased to be a cosponsor of this bill as it was reintroduced at the beginning of this Congress in January. I'm convinced it is time for the Senate to take action to reform the way federal election campaigns are financed, and, in effect, overwhelmingly dominated by the huge amounts of unregulated and undisclosed money being spent by organizations, unions, corporations, and wealthy individuals to influence the outcome of federal election campaigns. It is time to ensure that those who do try to influence the outcome of federal elections will have to report their expenditures so the general public will know who is trying to influence the outcome of political campaigns and how they are spending their money to do so. Mr. President, I also commend our Senate leaders, Mr. Lott and Mr. Daschle, for scheduling the debate on this bill so the Senate has an opportunity to work its will on the legislation. Amendments can be offered by any Senator with ample time for debate and consideration of any suggested alternatives for changing or improving this legislation. This bill, S. 27, in my view strikes the right balance that we are trying to accomplish. I may support some of the amendments that are offered. I will offer an amendment that I think will improve and strengthen the disclosure requirements in federal campaigns. I think the public has a right to know who is spending money to affect the outcome of federal elections and how they are spending it. We all see the ads. We are overwhelmed by the total number of television ads and mailings that are sent out during a political campaign these days in House races and Senate races and even the Presidential election this past year. Voters have to be confused about who is running the ads. The ad says the "Good Government Committee," but who is that? Or it says something else that sounds really good, like they are on the side of right and justice and right thinking. These groups run ads that suggest or insinuate that one or the other of the candidates in the race isn't on the right track, either on one subject or just generally speaking, isn't good for the state or the district or the country. The ads suggest that there may be something in the background of the candidate that is suspicious that needs to be looked at very carefully. The insinuations, the misleading tone, the negative aspect of political campaigns is fueled by the huge amounts, the juggernaut, and almost inconceivable amount of influence being brought to bare on these campaigns, by who knows what source. Who knows who is behind the spending. So, I am hopeful that we will work hard to get a bill passed by the Senate. We have a wonderful opportunity to do so, and the time to act is now. Some of the raising and spending of the money looks more like money laundering operations than above board political campaigns that would reflect credit on the political system of our country, and that needs to be changed. This is the vehicle to use to change it. I'm hopeful the Senate will work its will and pass this legislation." ### <! ---------- Press Release / Speech Goes Above --------- >   Home | Biography | Press Releases | Legislation | Offices | CommitteesContact Me | Services | Audio Clips | Video Clips | Mississippi

The Foreign Language Acquisition and Proficiency Improvement Act of 2001 will also provide schools with incentives to initiate foreign language programs that promote technology and other innovative instruction techniques to make the teaching of foreign language more effective. According to the Center for Applied Linguistics, the early study of a second language offers many benefits for students including academic achievement, positive attitudes toward diversity, flexibility in thinking and a sensitivity to language. The results of a recent survey show a rising awareness and increase in the teaching of foreign languages. Cochran said, "The evidence shows that children who learn foreign languages score higher in all academic subjects than those who speak only English." Last year, Senator Cochran as Chairman of the Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on International Security, Proliferation, and Federal Services held hearings to examine the relationship between foreign language preparedness and national security. At the hearings, witnesses testified that there is a continuing need for highly proficient speakers of many languages for surveillance, reconnaissance, negotiations and other defense and intelligence gathering activities. They also testified that early foreign language instruction is the best predictor of foreign language proficiency in college. In addition to the need for foreign language skills in the arena of national security, a USA Today survey found that top executives cited foreign language skills twice as great as any other skill in demand. Cochran said, "The evidence of need is great, and yet there is a lack of sufficient foreign language training at the K-12 level. I hope that we will give greater attention to this program when we make funding decisions." ### <! ---------- Press Release / Speech Goes Above --------- >   Home | Biography | Press Releases | Legislation | Offices | CommitteesContact Me | Services | Audio Clips | Video Clips | Mississippi

U.S. Senator Thad Cochran (R-MS) has introduced a resolution designating March 2001 and March 2002 as "Arts Education Month." Last year, the Senate approved a similar resolution, marking for the first time, Congressional recognition of the annual celebration of music, art, dance and theatre programs in American schools. Senator Cochran said, "There is growing awareness that arts education can help America's students enhance their math and language skills, improve test scores, and provide increased opportunities for higher education and better jobs in the future." A study by the UCLA Graduate School of Education and Information Studies found that students who consistently act in plays and musicals, join drama clubs or take acting lessons showed gains in reading proficiency, self-concept and motivation. According to researchers, the findings were consistent for students regardless of parents' income, occupation or level of education. Cochran added, "I hope the United States Senate will again recognize the importance of arts education and adopt this resolution which will encourage schools and communities to engage in activities that highlight the arts and provide new experiences for students of all ages." ### <! ---------- Press Release / Speech Goes Above --------- >   Home | Biography | Press Releases | Legislation | Offices | CommitteesContact Me | Services | Audio Clips | Video Clips | Mississippi

Four years ago, Congress adopted a resolution establishing March 2 as "Read Across America Day" to highlight the importance of teaching strong reading skills and to demonstrate the value in taking time to read to children. The date commemorates the birthday of Theodor Geisel, better known as Dr. Seuss, whose books have been enjoyed by children and adults for many years. "Read Across America day provides an opportunity each year to inspire children to read and remind adults about the importance of taking an active role in a child's reading instruction," said Cochran, who was an original cosponsor of the reading resolution. This year more than 25 million children and adults will take part in Read Across America activities nationwide. Cochran said, "Parents, teachers and children must work together in our homes, schools and communities to encourage successful reading skills which will enable children to meet life's challenges with confidence." ### <! ---------- Press Release / Speech Goes Above --------- >   Home | Biography | Press Releases | Legislation | Offices | CommitteesContact Me | Services | Audio Clips | Video Clips | Mississippi

The letter, signed by a bipartisan group of 52 Senators, was sent to the White House today. The Senators are concerned that if action is not taken to renegotiate the current lumber agreement, which will expire on April 1, then U.S. timber owners in Mississippi and across the nation will suffer serious losses. Last month, President Bush met with Prime Minister Chretien of Canada to emphasize the seriousness of the softwood lumber crisis in America. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick met with Canadian Trade Minister Pettigrew to stress that this should be the number one bilateral trade issue. "Timber is our second most lucrative agriculture product, and competition from Canada and its government policies have hurt timber growers in our state," Cochran said. "We are working hard to encourage the Bush Administration to try to negotiate a fair trade agreement so that Mississippi timber owners are not put out of business by imported Canadian lumber." Lott said, "I think we need to be very aggressive in requiring the Canadians to comply with trade laws, and they have not been doing that. They are subsidizing their timber, and it's having a devastating effect on working men and women in Mississippi. This is unfair, and we cannot tolerate it." ### <! ---------- Press Release / Speech Goes Above --------- >   Home | Biography | Press Releases | Legislation | Offices | CommitteesContact Me | Services | Audio Clips | Video Clips | Mississippi

"Over the past three years, Congress has provided over $25 billion in emergency assistance for the U.S. agriculture sector which has experienced economic difficulties due to declining export demand, higher production costs, and weather-related problems," said Cochran, who, as Chairman of the Agriculture Appropriations panel, steered the emergency assistance package included in the funding bill to final passage each year. Cochran went on to say that "according to USDA and prominent agriculture economists, the U.S. agricultural economy will continue to face persistent low prices and depressed farm income this year and a strong rebound in farm prices and income from the market appears unlikely." In light of the fact that financial stress for America's farmers will continue, Cochran has written a letter to the Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee requesting emergency economic assistance. Cochran said, "I have asked the Chairman for his assistance, because I believe it is vitally important to provide at least as much total economic assistance for 2001 and 2002 as was provided for the 2000 crop year since farm income is not projected to improve." "While farmers and ranchers clearly prefer receiving their incomes from the market, federal assistance will be necessary until conditions improve as farmers strive to reduce costs and expand markets," Cochran said. "This action would address some of the problems in the short term, while allowing the Agriculture Committee the time to develop a comprehensive new farm bill when the current law expires." The Senator did not agree with those who believe that the existing farm policy should be changed in the middle of a crop year. Cochran said, "In addition to financial assistance, we can also combat these financial difficulties by developing policies and programs to ensure a competitive agricultural economy, reduce trade barriers, and open markets worldwide." Cochran agreed with a recent report of the Commission on 21st Century Agriculture that suggested continuing the fixed Agricultural Market Transition Act payment at existing levels with the adoption of an additional income support program to supplement payments to producers. The Senator also suggested retaining the current marketing assistance loan program and giving the President fast-track authority to help producers improve export opportunities. In addition to promoting trade and enhancing competitiveness, Senator Cochran stressed the importance of continued research to ensure successful and safe production of a wholesome food supply and a clean environment. The Senator noted some important changes in conservation policy during the 106th Congress, including the Wetlands Reserve Program, the Conservation Reserve Program and the Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program which resulted in increased protection of natural resources. "Last year landowners applied wildlife management plans on 12.3 million acres," Cochran said. ### <! ---------- Press Release / Speech Goes Above --------- >   Home | Biography | Press Releases | Legislation | Offices | CommitteesContact Me | Services | Audio Clips | Video Clips | Mississippi

U.S. Senators Thad Cochran and Trent Lott have submitted their recommendations to President George W. Bush for the offices of U.S. Attorney and U.S. Marshal for the Northern and Southern Districts of Mississippi. The Senators recommended Jim Greenlee of Oxford for the position of U.S. Attorney for the Northern District. Greenlee has served as an Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Northern District since 1987. After receiving his law degree in 1981 from the University of Mississippi he practiced law with the firm of Taylor and Whitwell in Southaven, Mississippi.

Lampton has served five consecutive terms as the District Attorney for the Fourteenth Circuit Court District. He also serves as Staff Judge Advocate for the 155th Separate Armored Brigade with the Army National Guard. After receiving his law degree in 1975 at the University of Mississippi School of Law, Lampton practiced law with the firm of Phillips, Regan & Lampton for four years. Senators Cochran and Lott recommended Larry Wagster of Oxford be appointed U.S. Marshal in the Northern District. Wagster, a 21-year-veteran of the FBI, has served as a Court Security Officer for the U.S. District Court of the Northern District for the past two years .

Senator Thad Cochran (R-MS) made the following statement at a news conference on campaign reform today: "Thank you very much Senator McCain, Senator Feingold. I am here with them today to announce that I think campaign reform legislation should be a high priority in the Senate this year, and I am looking forward to taking an active role in this effort. Candidates must comply with a lot of rules in the federal election process. They must disclose the source of all contributions they receive. There are limitations on the amounts of those contributions, and all expenditures have to be reported to the Federal Election Commission. Candidates are unable to compete with independent groups and others who don't have to disclose what they spend attacking candidates and supporting candidates. This has made the federal election process very unfair. That is one reason why I am interested in being a part of this campaign reform effort. John McCain and Russ Feingold have focused the attention of the nation on this issue, and the work they have done has been very important. We have an evenly divided Senate in a partisan sense this year. It seems to me the time is now, when we should try to find common ground and see if we can reach a consensus in the Senate on campaign reform. There have been a lot of changes suggested changes by Senators on this subject. I frankly am very impressed with the Snowe/Jeffords Title of the McCain/Feingold bill. There are other parts of McCain/Feingold that I don't find all that attractive, but I think we need to move this issue to a high priority on the agenda of the Senate this year. I am glad to be a part of this effort." Cochran's response to the question "Why now?": "I have been in favor of campaign reform for a long time. When I was a member of the House over 20 years ago, I was a part of an effort with John Anderson to modify the campaign finance laws. When I came to the Senate, we had opportunities to make some improvements, but we really haven't achieved what I thought was all we should do to help make the election process something all Americans could be proud of. I think we have a system now that is too heavily influenced by fundraising and the spending of money not just by candidates, but other groups, whether they are political parties, and I think we should protect their role incidently, or other organized groups without any requirements to disclose the sources of contributions, or what their agenda is, or how much money is being spent, or what way the money is being spent. We know a lot of advertising is being purchased, but how else is the money being spent to influence federal election outcomes? I just think that the whole system has become overwhelmed by organizations which use enormous sums of money to influence campaigns. Maybe that's protected under the freedom of speech clause, but I think we can require disclosure, and some limitations can be imposed. They are imposed on candidates, and it seems to me they should be imposed on others." ### <! ---------- Press Release / Speech Goes Above --------- >   Home | Biography | Press Releases | Legislation | Offices | CommitteesContact Me | Services | Audio Clips | Video Clips | Mississippi

The U.S. House of Representatives adopted S. 2020 last night, a bill introduced earlier this year in the Senate by Senator Thad Cochran (R-MS), to adjust the boundary of the Natchez Trace Parkway to add approximately 230 acres of land. "My interest in the Natchez Trace Parkway began back in 1973 when, as a new member of Congress, I introduced my first bill, H.R. 3074, to provide funds to complete the Parkway," Cochran said. "I am pleased the Congress has approved this bill which will protect the scenic beauty of the Trace." The legislation authorizes 150 acres to be used for an alternative alignment of the roadway terminus to Liberty Road in Natchez and 80 acres for inclusion of Emerald Mound, the second largest Indian mound in North America, within the Parkway Boundary. The Mississippi State Legislature has provided $8.5 million in bond authority for acquisition of the 150 acres necessary to modify the terminus alignment. The bill, which must now be signed by the President, also authorizes the Secretary of Interior to acquire, sell or exchange property to conform with the adjusted boundary. During the late 1700's and early 1800's the Natchez Trace was a primitive trail connecting the old Southwest Territory on the Lower Mississippi River with the Ohio River Valley. Today, it is a paved road with historical points of interests that extends from Natchez, Mississippi, to Nashville, Tennessee. Cochran said, "Only about 20 miles of the 445-mile parkway remain to be completed, including the terminus in Natchez, and this bill will help move us toward this important goal for Mississippians and for those who visit our State." ### <! ---------- Press Release / Speech Goes Above --------- >   Home | Biography | Press Releases | Legislation | Offices | CommitteesContact Me | Services | Audio Clips | Video Clips | Mississippi

"The Congressional Recognition for Excellence in Arts Education Act establishes an award for outstanding arts education programs which will encourage more schools to provide arts courses," Cochran said. Last year, the Arts Education Partnership, a private, nonprofit coalition of organizations, released a report which identified 91 American school districts with successful arts curriculum programs. Hattiesburg and Starkville were the only Mississippi school districts which were included. "With the adoption of this new recognition program, I think more Mississippi school districts will take steps to achieve excellence in arts education," Cochran said. "Many professional studies, including the 1997 National Assessment of Educational Progress Arts Report Card, have reported the relationship of arts education to brain development, student achievement and career potential. They also have shown that arts instruction can improve competency and literacy, lower the likelihood of delinquent behavior, and encourage attendance and achievement of at-risk high school students," Cochran added. ### <! ---------- Press Release / Speech Goes Above --------- >   Home | Biography | Press Releases | Legislation | Offices | CommitteesContact Me | Services | Audio Clips | Video Clips | Mississippi

The conferees approved $3.6 billion in emergency relief funds for American farmers and ranchers, which includes crop loss and disaster assistance, $490 million for livestock assistance, and $473 million for dairy assistance. The bill gives the Secretary of Agriculture access to the Commodity Credit Corporation for crop and quality loss assistance, thus avoiding proration of payments as in previous years. Cochran said, "The farmers of this country continue to work hard to provide a safe and abundant food supply while battling difficulties on every front. This bill will respond to their needs by providing emergency assistance to compensate for losses, including those farmers in Mississippi who have suffered from drought problems this year." In addition, the bill contains $873 million for conservation programs of the Department of Agriculture, an increase of $69 million over last year. The bill authorizes the enrollment of an additional 100,000 acres in the Wetlands Reserve Program bringing the total enrollment in the program up to 1,075,000 acres. The legislation also authorizes the Secretary to continue the Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program. The conferees approved $1.88 billion for agriculture research, education and extension programs, an increase of $104 million over last year. The Agriculture Research Service will receive $898 million, and the activities of the Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension Service are funded at $981.6 million. The legislation provides $3.09 billion in authorized loan levels for agricultural credit programs for farmers, which is a $14 million increase over last year. The bill also provides $5.07 billion for rural housing loans and $680 million for rural housing rental assistance. In addition, rural economic and community development programs will receive $644.4 million for loans and grants for rural water and sewer facilities. The Food Safety and Inspection Service is funded at $696.7 million, an increase of $47.6 million above last year, $8.5 million more than the President's request. An additional $30 million is also provided for food safety activities of the Food and Drug Administration, which is also funded in this appropriations bill. The bill contains almost $34.1 billion for federal nutrition assistance, including the school lunch and breakfast programs, food stamps, and the WIC program. The conference report also requires lifting the ban on food and medicine exports to Cuba, Iran, Libya, North Korea and Sudan which will provide additional markets for U.S. farmers to sell their crops. Cochran said, "These programs will promote efficient farming methods, fund innovative research, and encourage trade policies that increase access to markets worldwide." The Conference Report must now be approved by the Senate and the House of Representatives before it is sent to the President to be signed. ### <! ---------- Press Release / Speech Goes Above --------- >   Home | Biography | Press Releases | Legislation | Offices | CommitteesContact Me | Services | Audio Clips | Video Clips | Mississippi

Cochran Fellows have been trained in a variety of fields ranging from livestock management to agricultural economics. The program seeks to help improve agricultural trade between developing countries and the United States. A number of former participants in the Cochran program attended today's event, including Kubahycbek Omuraliev, the agricultural minister counselor to the United States from the Kyrgyz Republic.

A DECADE OF FACTS ABOUT BALLISTIC MISSILE DEFENSE <! --- Insert the Press Release Immediately Following --- > FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Contact: Beth Day September 6, 2000 (202)224-6404 STUBBORN THINGS ? A DECADE OF FACTS ABOUT BALLISTIC MISSILE DEFENSE Today I am pleased to release a new report that I hope will be a useful resource in the debate over the most important national security issue now facing our nation ? the question of our ballistic missile defense program. The report is entitled Stubborn Things ? A Decade of Facts About Ballistic Missile Defense, and as its title suggests, it is a compilation of relevant facts about the conduct of our ballistic missile defense program from 1991 through the beginning of last month, when we sent it to the printer. In assessing the current state and the future of our ballistic missile defense program, it's important to understand how we got to where we are; this report will help do that. For example, last week President Clinton declined to take the first steps toward deployment of our National Missile Defense system in part because he believed the technology was not yet mature enough. In particular, he cited developmental delays with the NMD system's ground-based interceptor missile. The speed of development of the interceptor missile was not due to some law of physics. As Stubborn Things documents, in February of 1993 ? less than one month after taking office ? the Clinton administration returned unopened to defense contractors their proposals for moving forward with the ground-based interceptor, and the interceptor program languished for several years. The state of our ballistic missile defense program today is the result of deliberate policy decisions taken in the last ten years; Stubborn Things documents those decisions. The compilation begins in 1991 because three important events took place that year. First, the Scud missile attack which killed 28 American soldiers in a barracks in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia brought home to many Americans the threat of ballistic missiles and our vulnerability to them. Second, 1991 marked the reorientation of the National Missile Defense program to one focused on limited missile attacks. And along with this reorientation, President Bush began promising negotiations with the Soviet Union over amending the 1972 ABM Treaty to reflect the new realities of a post-Cold War world. As our report documents, those negotiations were abandoned by the Clinton administration as soon as it took office, and revived only last year after passage of the National Missile Defense Act. Now, however, the Russians aren't interested in negotiating, and the President last week cited Russia's refusal to permit him to go forward as the other principal reason he would not begin deployment of the NMD system. Stubborn Things contains ten chapters, corresponding to each year from 1991 to 2000. Each chapter includes a chronological recitation of events relevant to the ballistic missile defense program ? including developments in the missile threat and in arms control ? as well as funding data. There are also several appendices, one containing funding summaries such as this one, which contrasts the National Missile Defense funding planned by the Bush administration with that actually requested by the Clinton administration. Another appendix includes statements by Russian government officials which provide a sense of their determination to prevent the United States from defending itself against ballistic missile attack. The appendices also include information on the missile threat as well as the text of the ABM Treaty and related documents. In 1770, John Adams was called on to defend the British officer and soldiers accused of murder in the Boston Massacre. Adams believed in the power of facts, and at the trial said, "Facts are stubborn things; and whatever may be our wishes, our inclinations, or the dictates of our passions, they cannot alter the state of facts and evidence." The report I am releasing today will provide a useful compilation of facts and evidence to remind us in the continuing debate over our ballistic missile defense program that actions and decisions have consequences. ### <! ---------- Press Release / Speech Goes Above --------- >   Home | Biography | Press Releases | Legislation | Offices | CommitteesContact Me | Services | Audio Clips | Video Clips | Mississippi  
764	Server: Sun-ONE-Web-Server/6.1 Date: Sun, 04 Sep 2005 00:10:01 GMT Content-type: text/html Connection: close SENATOR THAD COCHRAN REMARKS AT COMDEF 2000 NATIONAL PRESS CLUB <! --- Insert the Press Release Immediately Following --- > FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Contact: Beth Day September 6, 2000 (202)224-6404 SENATOR THAD COCHRAN REMARKS AT COMDEF 2000 NATIONAL PRESS CLUB I'd like to thank the organizers of "ComDef 2000" for inviting me to speak at today's conference. I am honored to have the opportunity to address this fifteenth in the series of conferences that began in 1987. International defense cooperation is at the heart of our alliance structure. If the United States is to continue be an effective alliance leader it must have the capability to defend itself and its allies from the long-range ballistic missile threat. Therefore, I will address the issue of National Missile Defense, discussing not only where the United States is today on this subject but where we will go in the future, and also how we got to where we are now. Last week President Clinton announced his decision against proceeding now with the deployment of a National Missile Defense system. In so doing he emphasized two areas ? the state of technology and the potential effect of deployment on the international community ? that were of particular importance in his consideration of this decision. I agree with some of what the President said last Friday. For example, he is correct in stating that the ballistic missile threat is, and I quote, "real and growing," and that there are "near-term" threats from North Korea and the Middle East. He is also right when he says that America's national security policy cannot start and end with National Missile Defense. I don't know any supporter of NMD who believes otherwise, though some opponents like to suggest that NMD supporters are oblivious to all other threats and means of delivery of weapons of mass destruction. Of course this is not true. John Adams, America's second president, and the lawyer who defended a British officer and six soldiers accused of the 1770 Boston Massacre, said in his clients' defense at trial, and I quote, "Facts are stubborn things; and whatever may be our wishes, our inclinations, or the dictates of our passions, they cannot alter the state of facts and evidence." Adams' clients were subsequently acquitted of murder in spite of the public anger and "passions" that had been aroused against them. Similarly, while National Missile Defense stirs emotions today, the decisions of policy makers must be based upon the facts rather than on "our wishes, our inclinations, or the dictates of our passions?." Later this afternoon, as chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on International Security, Proliferation, and Federal Services, I will release a report entitled Stubborn Things ? A Decade of Facts About Ballistic Missile Defense. After my remarks here an advance copy of this report will be made available to everyone at today's conference, on the condition that it is embargoed for release until 2:30 this afternoon. This report contains a compilation of key facts on missile defense since 1991. I believe it will remind us that actions have consequences. This is evident in President Clinton's skepticism about the readiness of NMD technology, which is the consequence of the actions and deliberate policy decisions of his administration. The President singled out in his speech on Friday the lack of progress on the NMD ground-based interceptor as one key reason for delaying deployment. My report documents that in February of 1993 the Clinton Defense Department returned unopened to defense contractors proposals for moving forward with that interceptor, and work on the program subsequently languished for several years. Another pattern of the Clinton years documented in my report is the administration's dedication to the obsolete 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile, or ABM, Treaty. This has had ramifications in many areas. Because of the ABM Treaty, the Clinton administration has deliberately retarded the development, testing, and deployment of missile defenses and foreclosed research on many promising technological options. The funding data in my report show another pattern of inaction by the Clinton administration which has hindered missile defense progress. For example, in fiscal year 1995 ? just five years ago ? the Clinton administration spent $82 million on National Missile Defense. To put that figure in perspective, $82 million would not have covered the cost of the last NMD intercept test. The $82 million was a 64% reduction by the Democratic Congress to the President's budget request for NMD, but this reduction didn't draw a veto threat, or even an expression of concern, from President Clinton or any of his advisors. Moreover, that 64% reduction to National Missile Defense for FY ?95 by the Congress came after President Clinton had already cut the last Bush NMD funding plan for FY '95 by 95%. Together, the actions of President Clinton and his colleagues in the Democratic party who controlled Congress at the time reduced the planned Bush FY '95 NMD request by more than 98%. The facts about NMD funding demonstrate that through FY '99, the last year of the final Bush Defense Department funding plan, each and every funding request by President Clinton for National Missile Defense was lower than the Bush Administration's plan. It is in this context that President Clinton announced last Friday that he doesn't believe the readiness of NMD technology warrants a decision to proceed with deployment of National Missile Defense. His actions certainly have had a major impact on this aspect of the program. Other patterns also emerge in the Clinton administration's handling of the ballistic missile defense program. Among them are a consistent record, until very recently, of denying that a ballistic missile threat to the United States exists, despite the mounting evidence; an emphasis on arms control over military capability; consistent and fierce opposition to Republican missile defense initiatives; and a tendency to pretend to support the missile defense effort without really doing so. Therefore, the status of our missile defense program today is not the result of some immutable law of physics, but of the many decisions of President Clinton and officials in his administration since January of 1993. This brings me to where we are today. Despite agreeing with some of what President Clinton said in his speech last Friday, on this subject there is much that I disagree with. First, I don't agree with the President's assessment of the state of readiness of our NMD technology. Of the three intercept attempts we have had thus far in the testing program, one ? the first ? resulted in an intercept; one resulted in a nominal test until the last five seconds of flight, when there was a low-tech plumbing problem that shut down the infrared sensors in the interceptor; and one resulted in no performance by the interceptor because a component of its surrogate booster malfunctioned. So, we have had one intercept in three attempts. But that is not all we've seen in the test program. The ABM x-band radar has performed flawlessly, demonstrating capability well in excess of its design parameters. The battle management, command, control, and communications system has also performed well beyond its design. As a matter of fact, every element of the NMD system has been successfully demonstrated in the flight test program. The technology is ready. Of course it is generally preferable to have more testing. But the NMD program is not being developed because it is an interesting engineering challenge; we are pushing the program ahead because of the threat. Professional testers always want more tests and longer schedules, but we must proceed based not upon the schedules of these professional testers, but on the schedule of the threat. It is the pace of this threat that compels us to accept more schedule risk in the NMD program; while some may want to evaluate the adequacy of a test program in isolation from external factors like the nearness and pace of the ballistic missile threat, policy makers who are responsible for our nation's security do not have that luxury. Some like to describe this as a "high risk" program. But, as retired Air Force Chief of Staff Larry Welch, head of the Welch Panel, has testified, the risk in this program is not due to the technology but it is due to the schedule. Put another way, the risk isn't that we won't be able to build the system, or that it won't work, but that we won't be able to build the system on the 2005 schedule. I've already talked about why this is the case. General Welch has also testified recently that, though the NMD schedule is "high risk," it should not be changed until events in the testing program require it to change. While not all of the elements have been demonstrated to work in a single test, all of the necessary elements have worked in one test or another. Given the reality of the threat, we should proceed with deployment as scheduled. And here we have a fundamental contradiction in the President's speech from Friday. Defense Department officials have testified that they cannot meet the 2005 deployment deadline if they do not begin this spring construction of the Shemya radar ? the radar that has performed so well. All of you are familiar with the amount of time the process takes for requesting, submitting, and judging proposals, so there is no dispute that to begin construction of the Shemya radar in the spring the contract must be awarded within the next two months, particularly since all the necessary equipment must first be collected in Seattle, put on barges, and moved by sea to Shemya. So the President's announcement guarantees that a 2005 deployment is out of the question. Therefore, far from leaving options open for the next president, President Clinton's announcement in fact ties the hands of his successor by preventing him from deploying National Missile Defense as soon as technologically possible. Of course, in continuing this pattern of discussing the issue, the President insisted Friday that his decision does not represent a delay in the program, because, and I quote him, "The best judgement of the experts who have examined this question is that, if we were to commit today to construct the system, it most likely would be operational about 2006 or 2007." End of quote. If that's the case, then it's hard to understand why the administration didn't change the schedule well before the President's speech. Moreover, if that's the case another statement from the President's speech, and I quote, "There is a reasonable chance that all these challenges can be met in time," is hard to understand. If there is "a reasonable chance that all these challenges can be met in time," then we should not now announce a postponement in the schedule, particularly after the President acknowledged early in his speech that the ballistic missile threat is "real and growing." The President should have authorized moving forward with construction at Shemya, construction which is not scheduled to begin for another seven months. According to an excellent story in Sunday's New York Times, this is in fact what Defense Secretary Cohen recommended to President Clinton. This seven months before beginning construction would give the President and his successor additional time to negotiate with Russia. The funds required for construction are provided in the FY '01 Defense Appropriations Act, which has been signed into law; and proceeding with Shemya construction would preserve the 2005 date. Lieutenant General Kadish, the Director of the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization, has testified to the Senate that even if deployment is delayed beyond 2005 the radar construction should still begin this spring because of the difficult environment in Shemya. Though he stated specifically in his speech that "no nation can ever have a veto" over a U.S. decision to proceed with deployment of NMD, the simple fact of the matter is that Russia, at least temporarily, has delayed the deployment of our National Missile Defense system. The fact is that the Clinton administration put a proposal to modify the ABM Treaty to allow for deployment of an NMD before the Russian government in January of this year. Since then eight months have passed and the Russian government has steadfastly refused to negotiate, let alone even discuss or ask questions about, this proposal. Had Russia accepted the proposal it is hard to imagine the President would have given the speech he gave on Friday. That's not to say the Russian government hasn't been talking about NMD and the ABM Treaty since January. Appendix B of my report documents many of the statements Russian leaders have made about our proceeding with this system. Senior Russian leaders have been very active on this front, working continuously to split the Western Alliance and stir up opposition to NMD around the world. And, their efforts have been very successful. The decision to delay deployment of NMD is the latest along a trail of bad decisions by the Clinton administration on ballistic missile defense. But, one fact remains, and that is that Public Law 106-38, The National Missile Defense Act of 1999, makes it the policy of the United States to deploy a limited missile defense system to protect the territory of the United States when the necessary technology is ready. That is the law, and that is precisely what I predict the United States will do. Thank you. ### <! ---------- Press Release / Speech Goes Above --------- >   Home | Biography | Press Releases | Legislation | Offices | CommitteesContact Me | Services | Audio Clips | Video Clips | Mississippi  
765	Server: Sun-ONE-Web-Server/6.1 Date: Sun, 04 Sep 2005 00:10:04 GMT Content-type: text/html Connection: close SENATE APPROVES FUNDING FOR AGRICULTURE <! --- Insert the Press Release Immediately Following --- > FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Contact: Beth Day July 21, 2000 (202)224-6404 SENATE APPROVES FUNDING FOR AGRICULTURE Washington, D.C. -- Last night, the Senate approved a bill authored by Senator Thad Cochran (R-MS) to provide $75.7 billion in appropriations funding for programs and activities of the U.S. Department of Agriculture and related agencies for fiscal year 2001. "The bill provides the resources to continue to support U.S. agriculture by enabling farmers and ranchers to be more efficient, assuring food safety, and breaking down barriers to trade," said Cochran, who chairs the subcommittee. The Senate approved $450 million in emergency crop loss assistance for farmers. Livestock producers and dairy farmers will receive $893 million in emergency assistance. Cochran said, "This bill responds to the needs of farmers who continue to experience weather-related disaster losses this year." In addition, the bill includes $867.6 million for the various conservation programs of the Department of Agriculture, an increase of $63.4 million more than last year. The bill authorizes the enrollment of an additional 100,000 acres in the Wetlands Reserve Program and authorizes the Secretary to access other funds to continue the Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program. "These conservation funds provide technical assistance and cost-sharing for programs which help landowners protect our valuable natural resources. I am particularly pleased that the Senate approved additional acreage enrollments in the Wetlands Reserve Program and funds for the Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program," said Cochran. The legislation includes an increase of $60.4 million over last year's funding levels for agriculture research, education and extension programs. The Agriculture Research Service will receive $871.6 million, and the activities of the Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension Service are funded at $964.8 million. The Senate approved $3.1 billion in authorized loan levels for agricultural credit programs for farmers. The bill also provides $4.56 billion for rural housing loans and $680 million for rural housing rental assistance. In addition, rural economic and community development programs will receive $644.4 million for loans and grants for rural water and sewer facilities. The Food Safety and Inspection Service is funded at $678 million, an increase of $28.9 million above last year. An additional $30 million is also provided for food safety activities of the Food and Drug Administration, which is also funded in this appropriations bill. The Senate also approved $35 billion for federal nutrition assistance, including the school lunch and breakfast programs, food stamps, and the WIC program. Differences between the House and Senate versions of the legislation will be resolved in conference. ### <! ---------- Press Release / Speech Goes Above --------- >   Home | Biography | Press Releases | Legislation | Offices | CommitteesContact Me | Services | Audio Clips | Video Clips | Mississippi  
766	Server: Sun-ONE-Web-Server/6.1 Date: Sun, 04 Sep 2005 00:10:07 GMT Content-type: text/html Connection: close SENATOR COCHRAN COMMENTS ON CHARGES REGARDING FALSIFIED TEST DATA ON THE NATIONAL MISSILE DEFENSE PROGRAM <! --- Insert the Press Release Immediately Following --- > FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Contact: Beth Day June 9, 2000 (202)224-6404 SENATOR COCHRAN COMMENTS ON CHARGES REGARDING FALSIFIED TEST DATA ON THE NATIONAL MISSILE DEFENSE PROGRAM Washington, D.C. ? Senator Thad Cochran (R-MS) made the following statement today on the floor of the U.S. Senate: "On May 11, Mr. Ted Postol, a physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, wrote to a number of Clinton administration officials claiming to have discovered evidence that the National Missile Defense system now being tested will be easily defeated by simple countermeasures, that the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization's own data proved this, and that BMDO and its contractors conspired to hide this information by tampering with flight test data. Mr. Postol also claimed that BMDO had altered the National Missile Defense flight test program in order to hide the truths he claimed to have discovered. Mr. Postol says he discovered the fatal weakness in the NMD system after studying BMDO data from Integrated Flight Test 1A, which was conducted in June, 1997, and was a test of a prototype kill vehicle built by the Boeing Company for the NMD interceptor missile. The test was not an attempt to destroy the target, but only to understand the seeker's performance. It was intended specifically to understand how well the infrared sensor on the kill vehicle performed, compared to expectations, when it encountered a target warhead and a number of decoys and other penetration aids. Mr. Postol contends that the results of Flight Test 1A showed that the NMD kill vehicle could not distinguish between a simple balloon decoy and an actual warhead, and that the entire test program, beginning with Integrated Flight Test 2, was restructured using far simpler targets to cover up this deficiency in the capacity of the vehicle to operate properly. This contention by Mr. Postol is just not true. The facts are that Flight Test 1A involved a kill vehicle built by the Boeing Company. Flight Test 2 was conducted with a kill vehicle built by Raytheon, and used exactly the same target complex as Flight Test 1A, contrary to Mr. Postol's claims. Simpler targets were used in Flight Tests 3 and 4 because these tests had different objectives. Flight tests 1A and 2 were intended to characterize the performance of the competing seekers; Flight Test 3 was the first attempt to intercept and destroy a target warhead. Just as testing of any new aircraft begins with a taxi test, then a simple takeoff and landing, the first NMD intercept testing began with a single warhead accompanied by a balloon decoy. Subsequent tests will become progressively more difficult, an approach which follows the recommendations of a panel of experts headed by retired Air Force Chief of Staff Larry Welch. In fact, the Welch panel recommended that the Defense Department attempt its first intercept without countermeasures of any kind, in order to begin the testing as simply as possible, but BMDO believed it was worth the risk to attempt a more complicated test. Mr. Postol appears to be unaware that the Boeing kill vehicle is no longer being used in the flight test program. The competing kill vehicle built by Raytheon, which has independently developed software, was selected for the NMD system and has been used in every test since Flight Test -1A. Mr. Postol claims to have discovered in the data from Flight Test -1A that - and I quote - "the Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle (EKV) will be defeated by the simplest of balloon decoys." The fact is that in Flight Test-3, on October 2, 1999, exactly the opposite happened, when the EKV disregarded a balloon decoy and successfully destroyed its target. This isn't the first time Mr. Postol has been notoriously wrong about our missile defense program. In 1994, when the United States was preparing to conduct the first flight test of its Theater High Altitude Area Defense - or THAAD - system, he and some of his colleagues at MIT, in an article in Arms Control Today, claimed to have demonstrated that theater missile defenses like THAAD would - and I quote - "almost certainly have significant capabilities against strategic RVs [reentry vehicles]" and that any agreement permitting such capabilities would - I quote - "significantly erode the ability of the ABM Treaty to control strategic defenses by allowing systems that could defend areas of tens of thousands of square kilometers." As it turns out, in spite of that suggestion by Mr. Postol and his colleagues at MIT, even the government of Russia never complained about THAAD or similar systems which Mr. Postol said would so upset the strategic balance. And when other technical experts challenged his conclusions, Mr. Postol adopted the tactics of questioning the competence and integrity of his critics. A technical team under contract to the Defense Department reviewed Mr. Postol's THAAD findings and found they contained errors. Mr. Postol's response was to write a series of letters to government officials, accusing the technical team whose findings differed from his of "spreading false and misleading information" that "impugns the scholarly reputation of myself and my colleagues." He accused the general officer heading the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization of mismanagement and of "providing false information to members of the Russian Duma" in an attempt to - in his words - "influence the Russian debate through subterfuge." Mr. Postol demanded that the Defense Department retract its study and issue a letter acknowledging its errors. DoD did not do this because they were right all along and it was Postol and his MIT colleagues who were wrong again. Two years later, in 1996, Postol's campaign against missile defenses had taken a new approach. In addition to arguing that systems like THAAD would undermine the Russian strategic deterrent, Postol argued that they would be easily defeated by countermeasures. He said in effect that the TMD systems the U.S. was developing were so good that they would threaten the Russian strategic force and at the same time so bad that they could be easily defeated by even the simplest of countermeasures. Both those claims could not be true. Nonetheless, Mr. Postol continued to promote this argument, and created detailed drawings illustrating how an aspiring missile power might go about deploying countermeasures to U.S. missile defense systems. These ideas were elaborated in an 80 page document which Mr. Postol distributed widely and which was eventually made available on the Internet, so that anyone - including those who would benefit most from measures that could defeat U.S. weapon systems - could obtain it. The claim that Theater Missile Defenses would both threaten deterrence and at the same time be overwhelmed by simple countermeasures is now being made by Postol and his colleagues at MIT on the subject of the National Missile Defense program. He is arguing that any nation which can build a long-range ballistic missile can necessarily build in measures that will allow it to penetrate missile defenses. At the same time, these concerned scientists believe, or say they believe, that deployment of a limited NMD system - even though they believe they can scientifically prove it will not work - will cause Russia to maintain higher force levels and China to conduct a strategic buildup. All of this is contained in an elaborate, glossy, 175-page document which Mr. Postol and his colleagues have distributed widely. It is relatively easy to conceive of devices that are theoretically possible using scientific principles. The best science fiction employs just such an approach. But it is another thing altogether to transform those concepts from the realm of ideas into hardware. Actually engineering a complex device like a weapon system is far different from merely imagining it. For every idea that is transformed into hardware and subjected to the real world's trials, many others, thought up by smart people with Ph.D.s from the best universities, are discarded as impractical. Countermeasures are no less subject to this reality than are the weapon systems they are intended to frustrate. Imagining is one thing; designing, building and testing is quite another. And, countermeasures aren't free. Every countermeasure which someone attempts to put on a ballistic missile costs real money. Countermeasures also consume weight and space, which means lowered performance or less payload. Countermeasures introduce complexity, which means more things can go wrong and engineers must spend more time trying to ensure they go right. Engineers trying to perfect countermeasures are diverted from other activities they could be working on, such as extending a missile's range or improving its reliability. In short, successful pursuit of countermeasures means sacrificing something else, and some may not choose to make that sacrifice. Countermeasures are an issue that must be taken seriously by the designers of our missile defense systems. And, fortunately, they are. Whether the weapon is an artillery piece or a ballistic missile, it will have to confront efforts to counter it. In fact, missile defense is itself a countermeasure to the ballistic missile. Missile defense should not be abandoned because of the probability that someone will attempt to develop a countermeasure. The talented men and women of our National Missile Defense program - who are operating in the real world in which ideas must be translated into hardware that works - are anticipating and preparing for countermeasures. This is a point that has apparently been lost on Mr. Postol and his concerned colleagues, who would have us believe that new capabilities materialize because they can imagine them. I believe we are going to see more not less criticism as we move forward to implement the provisions of the National Missile Defense Act, Public Law 106-38, and begin to deploy our national missile defense system. Some of the critics have impressive academic credentials. Fortunately, however, people who are impressive experts in the design and construction of our modern weapon systems, including BMD systems, are working hard to carry out the mandates of our government to build missile defense systems that will protect our Nation and all American citizens. An interesting article on missile defenses entitled "By Winding Stair," written by Mr. John O'Sullivan, appeared in the June 5 issue of National Review. I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the Record." ### <! ---------- Press Release / Speech Goes Above --------- >   Home | Biography | Press Releases | Legislation | Offices | CommitteesContact Me | Services | Audio Clips | Video Clips | Mississippi

House and Senate conferees have completed action on crop insurance legislation that includes economic assistance funding for farmers, Senator Thad Cochran (R-MS) announced today. The bill provides $7 billion in economic assistance for farmers and authorizes $8 billion for crop insurance reform. The economic assistance program includes $5.4 billion for market loss payments, $500 million in assistance to oilseed producers, and $100 million for cottonseed assistance. An additional $1.1 billion is made available for producers of other crops. "These funds will help U.S. farmers who continue to suffer from financial distress due to persistently low commodity prices," said Cochran, who is a senior member of the Senate Agriculture Committee. "This conference agreement will ensure that crop insurance premiums are more affordable and will be very helpful to producers in Mississippi," Cochran added. The legislation imposes stronger penalties for fraudulent activities, requires coordination of records between the Farm Service Agency and the Risk Management Agency, and provides funding for the development of new crop insurance products. The Conference Report must be approved by the House and the Senate, before being sent to the President for his signature. ### <! ---------- Press Release / Speech Goes Above --------- >   Home | Biography | Press Releases | Legislation | Offices | CommitteesContact Me | Services | Audio Clips | Video Clips | Mississippi

"The bill provides the resources to continue to support U.S. agriculture by enabling farmers and ranchers to be more efficient, assuring food safety, and breaking down barriers to trade," said Cochran, who chairs the subcommittee. The legislation includes an increase of $60.4 million over last year's funding levels for agriculture research and extension programs. The Agriculture Research Service will receive $871.6 million, and the activities of the Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension Service are funded at $964.8 million. Cochran said, "The research programs funded in this bill are necessary to ensure high standards for food quality, improve agriculture production techniques, and promote and implement innovative technology to increase competitiveness in the world marketplace." The bill provides $3.1 billion in authorized loan levels for agricultural credit programs for farmers. The Food Safety and Inspection Service is funded at $678 million, an increase of $28.9 million above last year. An additional $24 million is also provided for food safety activities of the Food and Drug Administration, which is also funded in this appropriations bill. The Subcommittee approved $4.56 billion for rural housing loans and $680 million for rural housing rental assistance. In addition, rural economic and community development programs will receive $634.4 million for loans and grants for rural water and sewer facilities.

"We have seen over the years many proposals to improve the economic conditions of the Delta and improve the quality of life for the people here," said Cochran. "I believe that today's forum will help us explore better alternatives to help the Lower Mississippi Delta region. Creating a new federal bureaucracy as the Administration has proposed may not be the best way to go about it." In the President's annual budget, $30 million was requested to establish a Delta Regional Authority. During a recent hearing of the Subcommittee, the Senator said he was "suspicious" about how the funds would be spent and hoped the Administration would consider as an alternative using the resources at Mississippi universities and colleges which could provide more expertise than "a Washington person." Cochran pointed out that his Appropriations Subcommittee had approved $212 million in loans and grant programs for the Mississippi Delta region. He also said the Lower Mississippi Delta Development Commission, which was established in 1988, produced a ten year plan of action for economic development, but "much more can and should be done." Top officials from colleges and universities located in the Delta discussed with the Subcommittee their ideas about programs that are working and other programs that could be improved with federal assistance. Officials from the U.S. Departments of Agriculture, Education, and Transportation also participated in the hearing. Cochran said, "The efforts of educators at Mississippi Valley State University, Alcorn State University, Delta State University, and the community colleges have shown that they can produce good results in the area of economic growth, job training, and resource development in the Mississippi Delta. We need to give them more support from the federal level." ### <! ---------- Press Release / Speech Goes Above --------- >   Home | Biography | Press Releases | Legislation | Offices | CommitteesContact Me | Services | Audio Clips | Video Clips | Mississippi

The hearing will serve as a forum to examine the Administration's request of $153 million for the creation of a new Delta Regional Authority and possible alternatives to the President's proposal. During a recent hearing of the Subcommittee, Senator Cochran said he was "suspicious" about how the funds would be spent and hoped the Administration would consider as an alternative using the resources at several Mississippi universities and colleges which could provide more expertise than "a Washington person." "I believe we ought to consider using the resources at Mississippi Valley State University, Delta State University, Alcorn State University, and community colleges which have proven successful in assisting the lower Mississippi Delta region," said Senator Cochran, who is chairman of the Subcommittee. Cochran said, "I am pleased that Mississippi Valley State University has agreed to host this hearing. It will give our Subcommittee an opportunity to hear the views and suggestions of those who know the people and communities we are trying to help." The hearing will be held at 9:30 a.m. (Central) in the new Administration Building (4th floor Boardroom) at Mississippi Valley State University on Leflore Avenue in Itta Bena, Mississippi.

Cochran said, "In the last two years, Congress has provided over $15 billion in emergency assistance for agriculture due to weather-related disasters and economic crises, and additional funding might have to be allocated this year." Cochran went on to say "We've got our work cut out for us in the Congress to respond to the problems that we face in agriculture. A lot of farmers are really hurting, and there are a lot of ways Congress can help in addition to providing direct disaster assistance." The Senator suggested working to reduce the inheritance tax and other taxes that affect landowners. He also suggested steps that could be taken to lower energy costs. "Farmers are really getting hurt because of huge increases in fuel prices. We've seen changes in policies in this Administration that have made it very difficult to explore and produce domestic energy, and that needs to be reexamined," Cochran said. The Senator told the group that U.S. farmers and exporters must take advantage of the growing economic opportunity outside of U.S. borders. He said that we need to break down barriers to trade where we are being denied access to markets for agriculture commodities, and he cited China as an example. Senator Cochran said, "Congress needs to act this year to approve an agreement with China, so we will have better access to sell what we're producing in that market where one fifth of the world's population lives. I believe that the China market is a tremendous opportunity and that the agreement will be positive for agricultural exports to China." In addition to the Senator's annual address at today's luncheon, Cochran was presented with The Friend of Farm Bureau award for his efforts on behalf on U.S. agriculture. ### <! ---------- Press Release / Speech Goes Above --------- >   Home | Biography | Press Releases | Legislation | Offices | CommitteesContact Me | Services | Audio Clips | Video Clips | Mississippi

The U.S. Senate adopted a resolution introduced by Senator Thad Cochran (R-MS) today designating March, 2000 as Arts Education Month. Senator Cochran said, "I hope that by designating March of this year as Arts Education Month, more schools will engage in activities that showcase, celebrate, reward, and provide new arts experience." "Scientific research and other studies have shown that arts instruction provides multiple benefits for students that include higher I.Q.'s, better SAT scores, better math and language skills, less juvenile delinquency, better chances of higher education, and increased job opportunities," said Cochran. Cochran added, "I am glad the United States Senate has recognized the importance of arts education with the adoption of this resolution." ### <! ---------- Press Release / Speech Goes Above --------- >   Home | Biography | Press Releases | Legislation | Offices | CommitteesContact Me | Services | Audio Clips | Video Clips | Mississippi  
773	Server: Sun-ONE-Web-Server/6.1 Date: Sun, 04 Sep 2005 00:10:28 GMT Content-type: text/html Connection: close COCHRAN SPONSORS LEGISLATION TO INCREASE FUNDING FOR COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS <! --- Insert the Press Release Immediately Following --- > FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Contact: Beth Day February 24, 2000 (202)224-6404 COCHRAN SPONSORS LEGISLATION TO INCREASE FUNDING FOR COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS Washington, D.C. - Senator Thad Cochran (R-MS) has cosponsored a resolution proposing that the federal investment in community health centers, including those in Mississippi, be increased in order to double access to care over the next five years. The "Resolution to Expand Access to Community Health Centers," or "REACH" Initiative, was announced by Senator Cochran and a bipartisan group of Senators at a news conference today on Capitol Hill. Cochran said, "Typically in small towns and rural communities in our State these centers are the only source of primary health care for people who live in those areas. These are efficient providers of health care services and benefits, and we do need to make it a high priority in the Congress to work together in a bipartisan way to improve a source of health care services and benefits that have proven to be very effective." Senator Cochran observed that Mississippi ?pioneered' in the area of community health centers establishing the first rural health care center funded by the federal government in 1965 in Mound Bayou, Mississippi. He said, "It has been a wise investment, not only for that community, but it has been a role model for health centers throughout the country." The "Reach" Initiative, which is championed by the Mississippi Primary Health Care Association, proposes doubling the funding for community health centers over the next five years in order to expand access to health care for the medically uninsured and underinsured people throughout our nation. This additional investment would allow six to ten million Americans to receive health care by 2005. The resolution would provide for a continuation of the funding increases that the centers have received over the last two funding cycles. "I am happy to be a cosponsor, and I hope to see early passage of legislation to provide for an infusion of federal dollars to expand programs for community health centers throughout the country," Cochran said. ### <! ---------- Press Release / Speech Goes Above --------- >   Home | Biography | Press Releases | Legislation | Offices | CommitteesContact Me | Services | Audio Clips | Video Clips | Mississippi  
774	Server: Sun-ONE-Web-Server/6.1 Date: Sun, 04 Sep 2005 00:10:31 GMT Content-type: text/html Connection: close Cochran Comments on National Missile Defense System Testing <! --- Insert the Press Release Immediately Following --- > FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Contact: Beth Day January 24, 2000 (202)224-6404 Cochran Comments on National Missile Defense System Testing Washington, D.C. -- Senator Thad Cochran (R-MS) spoke on the floor of the U.S. Senate today about the recent National Missile Defense system test. Following is the Senator's statement: "Mr. President, last week the Department of Defense conducted its most recent flight test of our National Missile Defense system. A great deal has been said and written about this test in the last few days - much of it erroneous - and I think it's important that we draw the correct conclusions about what this test does and does not mean. The test conducted last week was one of a series of 18 scheduled flight tests of the National Missile Defense system, and only the second to actually attempt to intercept a strategic ballistic missile by colliding with it in space. The first test this past October was primarily a test of the vehicle that actually hits the target missile. Last week's test was significantly more complicated and involved additional, newly developed elements of the National Missile Defense system, such as the ground-based radar and the Battle Management Command, Control and Communications system. In fact, a senior Defense Department official told reporters before the test that the battle management system is - and I quote - "the most difficult and sophisticated part of this entire program." The latest test began with the launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. After its rocket engine burned out, the target missile deployed both a mock warhead and a balloon decoy intended to try to fool the interceptor missile. The missile was tracked by satellites and by the National Missile Defense system's ground-based radar at Kwajalein Atoll in the South Pacific, and the interceptor missile was launched to meet the target. It sighted the target missile and then closed on it. While the interceptor did not hit the target warhead, it appeared that all of the systems tested functioned properly until the final six seconds of the test, when the infrared sensors on the interceptor vehicle did not operate correctly - as they had in the October test. While the failure to hit the target is disappointing, it is hardly justification for all the negative comments I have heard about last week's test. It's important to remember that a test program involves the testing of weapon systems to see if they perform as they were designed. The purpose of this test program is to uncover problems and correct them. If it were possible to take a design straight from the drawing board to the field, we wouldn't need testing programs. We test because we expect to find problems and try to solve them. What's remarkable about the National Missile Defense testing is not that the intercept vehicle missed on the second test but that it succeeded on the first one. Many newly introduced elements had to work right on this most recent test even to achieve a near miss, and the really significant news on this test is that all of the new elements which added complexity to the challenge seemed to have performed very well; the only thing that apparently didn't work properly was the one element which was already proven to work in the October flight. Some of the critics of missile defense have said this test was a major setback for the program. It was not. In fact, it demonstrated significant progress in the development of a workable and reliable National Missile Defense capability. The October flight was primarily a test of the intercept vehicle and its ability to identify a target in space, discriminate between the warhead and a decoy, and collide with the warhead. It did exactly what it was designed to do, but critics of the program claimed that had the decoy not attracted the intercept vehicle's attention, it never would have detected the warhead. They argued that the system can not work when there are decoys, and only did work because there was a decoy. As ridiculous as that sounds, it has been echoed by those who have long opposed missile defense in any form. An editorial in the New York Times claimed that the October success was "lucky" and occurred "almost by accident." Now wait a minute and think about this. When two objects - each about the size of a chair, launched 4300 miles apart and traveling at a combined speed of 15,000 miles an hour - collide in the vastness of space 140 miles above the earth's surface, that's not an accident. That's a demonstration of some very capable technology and engineering. Clearly, for some, no amount of evidence will be convincing. But repeating something that's wrong doesn't make it right. Predictably, some are urging the National Missile Defense program be slowed down or even shelved in the wake of last week's test. For some critics, delay or cancellation is always the right course of action when it comes to missile defense. Others suggest abandoning this program for another approach using different basing modes, but that will only delay the National Missile Defense deployment we need now. Still others believe the administration's assessment of technological readiness should be delayed in order to remove the decision from presidential politics. This, too, would be a mistake. We have a National Missile Defense program because we have a growing vulnerability to the threat of ballistic missile attack. That threat will not wait for us to conduct a test program with perfect results, something that has never happened with any weapon system. Delay in deploying a defense against these missiles only serves the interests of our adversaries. This threat is growing. We must all remember that this program is not just an academic exercise. The Senate passed the National Missile Defense Act last spring; in September the Intelligence Community released a new National Intelligence Estimate of the ballistic missile threat which, according to its unclassified summary, judges that some rogue states may have ICBMs much sooner than previously thought, and that those missiles will be more sophisticated than previously estimated. In just the past few weeks, British authorities intercepted components bound for Libya for missiles with three times the range of Tripoli's current arsenal. According to news reports from last week, the Director of Central Intelligence cannot rule out that Iran may already be able to build a nuclear weapon. And this past weekend, North Korea said it was reconsidering its declaration to refrain from any more long-range missile tests, though of course a moratorium on flight testing, however long, does not mean that North Korea isn't making progress on its missile development programs. While the threat continues to intensify, we've already had too much delay in deploying a missile defense system. In fact, we are behind today precisely because those who counsel delay have long had their way, not because of any inherent problems with the technology. What's required now is that we stay the course we set for ourselves when we passed the National Missile Defense Act of 1999. That Act makes it the policy of the United States to deploy a National Missile Defense system as soon as technologically possible. With the successful test in October and last week's test incorporating additional elements of the National Missile Defense system, the talented men and women of our armed forces and industry have demonstrated that this system is technologically possible. The test program is in its early stages and much can and will be done to refine the system between now and the start of missile production. But there is no question that this technology is not just within our reach but is actually in our grasp now. I congratulate the Defense Department for the extraordinary technical accomplishments it has achieved so far, and urge it to continue to work to improve this important program. ### <! ---------- Press Release / Speech Goes Above --------- >   Home | Biography | Press Releases | Legislation | Offices | CommitteesContact Me | Services | Audio Clips | Video Clips | Mississippi

778	Server: Sun-ONE-Web-Server/6.1 Date: Sun, 04 Sep 2005 00:10:52 GMT Content-type: text/html Connection: close U.S. Senator Thad Cochran - Page Program Info   PAGE PROGRAM INFORMATION Your interest in the Congressional Page Program is a positive indication to Senator Cochran that you are a concerned American citizen with a willingness to learn and contribute significantly to the Legislative branch of our government. Perhaps such an association will crystallize a future for you in service to the United States and its citizenry, as it has for Page of past generations. The Page Program exposes students to many interesting and challenging experiences. Living away from home and attending school with students from across the country allows Pages to experience a myriad of new ideas, perspectives, and issues. Pages meet some of the Nation's most prominent leaders and witness firsthand the political debates of the United States Senate, often referred to as the "greatest deliberative body in the world." Pages play an important role in the day-to-day operation of the Senate. Their schedule can be long and tedious, and requires tremendous endurance; good health and stamina are requirements which cannot be waived. Page eligibility is limited to juniors in high school who will be 16 on or before the date of appointment. Certification of immunization and general health assessment, completed by a licensed physician, are required. Pages are also required to be covered by health insurance; if not covered, they will be required to enroll in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. Page duties consist primarily of delivery of correspondence and legislative material within the Congressional Complex. Other duties include taking messages for Members, calling them to the phone, preparing the Chamber for Senate sessions, and carrying bills and amendments to the desk. A rotation system is practiced so that every Page has an opportunity to experience all areas of services. Pages are paid on the basis of an annual salary of $14,500. Pages must be citizens of the United States or subject to agreements of the Department of State, and must have a social security number. A Page's day begins at 6:15 a.m. when he or she reports to the United States Senate Page School. The Senate Page School is accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and schools. Due to the varying lengths of service that Pages may be appointed for the Page School seeks to provide as smooth a transition as possible between Washington and the home school. In addition to providing the necessary requisites for a junior year course of study, including mathematics, English, social studies, and science, the Page School offers a Washington Seminar Program to assure each pupil's participation and exposure to the unique educational and cultural opportunities which exist in the nation's Capital. Foreign language study may be accomplished with the assistance of the Page's home school. Tutors will be provided, but all work must be completed outside the scheduled school and work hours. The school year consists of two semesters. The first semester runs from early September through January; the second from February through mid-June. Pages must submit a home school transcript and a certificate of immunization to quality for attendance at the school. The Senate Page School is located in the lower level of Webster Hall, the Senate Page Residence. Any questions specific to the Page School should be directed to Mrs. Kathryn Weeden, Principal, United States Senate Page School, United States Senate, Washington, D.C. 20510, (202) 224-3926. Following classes at the Page School, which extend until 9:30 a.m. or one hour prior to the commencement of the Senate, Pages report for duty to their respective Cloakrooms and work until 5:00 p.m. or until the Senate adjourns for the day, whichever is later. When sessions extend past 10:00 p.m., the next day's classes are postponed. Pages are required to live in the Daniel Webster Senate Page Residence during the school year. The cost of living in the residence hall is $450 per month and includes breakfast and dinner each day. Payment is made through payroll deduction. An initial security deposit of $250 is required to the residence. Webster Hall is located two blocks from the Hart Senate Office Building. Staff includes a Program Director, Administrative Aide and four proctors. Proctors reside in Webster Hall. Two floors encompass living quarters, one of which is designated for young women, the other young men. Each floor has a community day room for social activity. United States Capitol Police maintain a 24-hour security desk and a provision that required all individuals to present identification and all visitors and guest must sign in. Capitol Police patrol the area by car and foot regularly through the day and night. Webster Hall is monitored by a security alarm system and all emergency and safety measured required by the District of Columbia for community life structures are present and enforced. Dress requirements for men are navy blue suit, white long-sleeve shirt, dark blue tie, black shoes and dark socks. Women wear navy blue pant suits, white long-sleeve blouses, black shoes and dark socks. Pages are expected to fulfill their own dress requirements. Senate Pages must be sponsored by a Senator. There are thirty Pages positions in the United States Senate which serve its one hundred members, therefore not all Senators are able to appoint Pages. Due to the limited number of positions and the volume of interested students, competition is keen and, unfortunately, not all students who seek a position can be accommodated. Senators may also appoint students for the Summer Page Program. This program typically consists of two four-week sessions depending on the legislative calendar. All information for the summer program is identical to the school year program with the following exceptions: Summer Page dress requirements do not include a suit jacket. Since there is limited space in Webster Hall, Pages may live with their parents or a relative in the area; alternate housing arrangements must be approved in writing by the parents or legal guardian. Finally Page School is not in session during the summer program. If you are a Mississippian and are interested in applying for a Senate Page position with Senator Cochran and you meet the requirements of junior status and 16 years of age, you should complete the Page application. When and if you are notified of your selection to serve as a Page, you will be furnished with further information and requirements of the program. Thank you for interest in the United States Senate Page Program.       Home | Biography | Press Releases | Legislation | Offices Committees Contact Me | Services | Audio Clips | Video Clips | Mississippi

The first European settlement was established by the French in 1699. The flags of France, Spain, and Great Britain flew over the Mississippi Territory before it became the twentieth State in 1817. By the 1830s, high cotton prices ignited an economic explosion in the South, and Mississippi became one of the Nation's wealthiest States. Cotton was King, and plantation owners constructed mansions to certify their incredible wealth in an affluent era that ended with the War Between the States in 1861. Reminders of the Old South are found throughout Mississippi, from the mansions of Natchez to the cannons of Vicksburg, from the original State Capitol -- where secession was declared -- to Beauvoir, the last home of Jefferson Davis, the only President of the Confederacy. The land -- once prowled by Indians and explorers, cultivated by planters, and shaped by heroes -- now bustles with technological and cultural progress. The world's first heart and lung transplants were performed at the University of Mississippi Medical Center. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's John C. Stennis Space Center tests the powerful engines that propel astronauts into space. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Waterways Experiment Station in Vicksburg is the world's largest hydraulic research laboratory. Jackson is the only American city to host the International Ballet Competition that rotates annually among Jackson, Helsinki, Moscow, and Varna, Bulgaria.       Home | Biography | Press Releases | Legislation | Offices Committees Contact Me | Services | Audio Clips | Video Clips | Mississippi

Roger F. Wicker (R - 01) Rep. Bennie Thompson (D - 02) Rep. C. W. (Chip) Pickering (R - 03) Rep. Gene Taylor (D - 04) A Brief History of Mississippians in the United States Senate The territory destined to become Mississippi was ceded to the United States by Spain in 1795. Congress admitted Mississippi as the twentieth State on December 10, 1817, and the first Senators, Walter Leake and Thomas Hill Williams, took their seats the following day. Forty-five men have represented the "Magnolia State" in the Senate. Although 28 served less than a full six-year term, many gained influence through long service as spokesmen for the South or through exceptional oratorical and leadership skills. George Poindexter (1830-1835) was a brilliant orator and engaged in longstanding feuds with Daniel Webster and Andrew Jackson. Henry Stuart Foote (1847-1852) supported Henry Clay's Compromise of 1850 and served as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. Jefferson Davis ( 1847-1851; 1857-1861) was a leading defender of State rights during the sectional controversies leading up to the War between the States and served as President of the Confederacy. Hiram Revels (1870-1871) was the first African-American elected to the Senate, and Blanche K. Bruce (1875-1881) was the first African-American to serve a full term in the Senate. Lucius Q. C. Lamar (1877-1885) advocated reconciliation of the North and South after the War and became the only Mississippian to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court. James Z. George (1881-1897), known among his constituents as "the Great Commoner," played an important role in framing the Sherman Antitrust Act and worked for aid to education and civil service reform. John Sharp Williams (1911-1922) was the first U.S. Senator in the Nation to be elected by popular ballot. (He was first elected in 1911, after Mississippi had created a direct primary for U.S. Senate elections but before the Seventeenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution required it in 1913). Pat Harrison (1919-1941), as Chairman of the Finance Committee in 1935, guided the Social Security Act to passage, establishing a national retirement pension system. Senator James O. Eastland (1941-1941; 1943-1978) served as chairman of the Judiciary Committee and was a strong advocate of States' rights, agriculture, and national security. John C. Stennis (1947-1989) served in the Senate for 41 years, a record surpassed by only one other person. (Indeed, Senators Eastland and Stennis represented Mississippi concurrently in the Senate for 31 years, the longest period of simultaneous service of any State in the Union.) Senator Stennis not only served as chairman of the Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on Appropriations, he drafted the first formal code of ethics for the Senate and was selected to chair the forerunner of the present Select Committee on Ethics. The two Mississippians honored with statues in the Capitol were both Senators: the statue of Jefferson Davis is in Statuary Hall, and the statue of James Z. George stands in the Hall of Columns.

Senator Thad Cochran (R-MS) introduced a bill today to reauthorize and improve the existing civic education programs of the We the People program for elementary and secondary students and Civitas, the international teacher exchange program. "We the People and Civitas are preparing America's students and teachers to live and lead in the world by the standards and ideals set by our Founding Fathers," Cochran said. "We the People...The Citizen and the Constitution" is a course designed for high school civics classes that provides training for teachers, using a national network of law professionals and other volunteer community and business leaders. The program simulates Congressional hearings which are competitions at local, state and national levels. More than 82,000 teachers and 26.5 million students have participated in the We the People program since its beginning in 1985. Studies by the Education Testing Service have indicated that the program participants out perform other students in civics. Other studies show that We the People students are more likely to assume roles of leadership, responsibility and demonstrate civic virtue. Cochran's bill reauthorizes the Civitas International Civic Education Exchange Program, which links American civic educators with their counterparts in Eastern Europe and the states of the former Soviet Union. "This program is highly effective in building a community with a common understanding of teaching and improving the state of democracy education world-wide," Cochran said. Mississippi recently became the latest state to participate in this important international exchange program. Jones County Junior College in Ellisville, Mississippi will partner with universities in Texas and Florida in an exchange with Hungary and other countries. "I am pleased that Mississippi teachers will join the more than 8,000 other teachers who have participated in the Civitas training and exchange opportunities," Cochran said. " Susie Burroughs, Mississippi's new Civic Education program director, has demonstrated fine leadership and a strong commitment to this program." Burroughs is in Washington this week attending the annual meeting of The Center for Civic Education which administers We the People and Civitas. ### <! ---------- Press Release / Speech Goes Above --------- >   Home | Biography | Press Releases | Legislation | Offices | CommitteesContact Me | Services | Audio Clips | Video Clips | Mississippi

President Clinton nominated Tupelo Mayor, Glenn L. McCullough, Jr. to serve as a member of the Board of Directors of the Tennessee Valley Authority, U.S. Senators Thad Cochran, Trent Lott, and U.S. Representative Roger Wicker announced today. Early this year Senators Cochran and Lott recommended McCullough to the President for one of the vacant positions on the three-member board. Both Senators decided it was time for a Mississippian to be on the board since the last that served was Frank Smith who was appointed by President Kennedy. Senator Cochran said, "Having a well qualified Mississippian on the TVA board will be good for our State. Glenn McCullough is an excellent choice for this job. He has the intelligence, judgment and experience that will enable him to be a very effective member of this board." "This is great news for Mississippi," Senator Lott said. "Mississippi is an important part of TVA, and we deserve to have a member on this board. I'm going to make sure we have quick hearings on these nominees, and hopefully we can get them confirmed before Congress adjourns for the end of the year." McCullough has served as Mayor of Tupelo since 1997. He serves on the Executive Committee of the Mississippi Municipal League and the Governor's Special Task Force for Economic Development Planning. He previously worked as the Director of the Mississippi Office of the Appalachian Regional Commission and with McCullough Steel Products, his family's business. Wicker said, "I am very pleased the President has chosen Glenn McCullough, Jr. to serve on the Board of Directors of the Tennessee Valley Authority. Glenn's wealth of experience and knowledge, coupled with his professional dedication is just the right fit for the TVA Board. I'm proud to see a Mississippian nominated to this important position. Hopefully, the confirmation process in the U.S. Senate will move quickly so that Glenn can start having an immediate impact on the direction of this important agency. Glenn will bring a thoughtful, dedicated and cooperative approach to improving TVA throughout the seven-state region. I am confident that Glenn is the right choice for the TVA Board and that he will continue to demonstrate the vision and leadership we have come to admire in him during his tenure as Mayor. This announcement creates a leadership void in Tupelo city government, but I know Glenn will now be able to use his proven abilities for the good of all north Mississippi in his new capacity. McCullough's nomination must now be approved by the Senate. ### <! ---------- Press Release / Speech Goes Above --------- >   Home | Biography | Press Releases | Legislation | Offices | CommitteesContact Me | Services | Audio Clips | Video Clips | Mississippi

Week. The resolution encourages individuals and organizations across America to promote basic values and adopt the six core elements of good character. "It has been my honor to cosponsor this resolution with Senator Pete Domenici every year since 1994," said Cochran, who is an original member of the Character Counts! Coalition in the United States Senate. "Never have we seen a time in the life of our society that good character has been more important. Solid lessons in character must be taught by parents and families, schools, and religious groups." The Character Counts! Coalition is made up of more than 300 member organizations, including community groups, schools and businesses, who sponsor programs that emphasize the importance of good character traits in our society. These programs are based on the Coalition's six core elements, or "Pillars of Character." They are trustworthiness, respect, responsibility, fairness, caring, and citizenship. A 1996 National School Boards Association report found that schools with character education programs reported improvement in student leadership, discipline, violence, vandalism, academic performance, attendance and drug and alcohol incidents. In Mississippi, the Noxubee County Competitive Community Program, the Ocean Springs Chamber of Commerce, Kids With Character, and the Junior Auxiliary of Clinton are organizations who have joined the Character Counts! Coalition. "I congratulate these communities in our State on their important efforts and hope that this year more Mississippians will become involved in similar programs," Cochran said. "The examples we set about how we treat others, and what we accept in social behavior will influence not only our children, but all children." ### <! ---------- Press Release / Speech Goes Above --------- >   Home | Biography | Press Releases | Legislation | Offices | CommitteesContact Me | Services | Audio Clips | Video Clips | Mississippi

"My bill establishes the Congressional Recognition for Excellence in Arts Education Awards and a board to direct the activities needed to promote it, to encourage arts curriculum, and to determine eligible schools," Cochran said. Earlier this year, the Arts Education Partnership, a private, nonprofit coalition of organizations, released a report which profiles 91 American school districts with successful arts curriculum programs, including Hattiesburg and Starkville, Mississippi, school districts. "I am proud of the school districts in Hattiesburg and Starkville and the example they set for other American school districts," Cochran said. Another example of innovative efforts to support excellence and commitment in arts instruction is the Mississippi Arts Commission's Whole Schools Institute at Millsaps College, which began this year. It is a week of professional development in teaching, planning and implementing new curriculum. Many professional studies, including the 1997 National Assessment of Educational Progress Arts Report Card, have reported the relationship of arts education to brain development, student achievement, career potential and other life quality issues. They have shown that instruction in this area can improve competency and literacy. "The evidence of the positive effects of arts education on overall scholastic achievement is an incentive for students, parents, and schools," Cochran said. Other studies have shown that arts activity lowers the likelihood of delinquent behavior and encourages attendance and achievement of at-risk high school students. Cochran said, "Vision and excellence can't be mandated, but through legislation, such as the Congressional Recognition for Excellence in Arts Education Act, we can reward it." ### <! ---------- Press Release / Speech Goes Above --------- >   Home | Biography | Press Releases | Legislation | Offices | CommitteesContact Me | Services | Audio Clips | Video Clips | Mississippi

Cochran was joined by Senator Blanche Lincoln (D-AR) in sponsoring the bill. "We developed this bill with the intent of addressing the reasons why farmers in our states have found crop insurance to be impractical," Cochran said. The legislation requires the Department of Agriculture to establish premium discounts for producers who use sound agricultural management and new technologies, and for those who have not filed claims in the last five years. "Our bill protects new farmers and those who rent new land or produce new crops by ensuring they are assigned a fair yield until they generate actual production data," Cochran stated. The legislation is designed to improve the management and oversight of the crop insurance program by establishing the Farm Service Agency as the sole agency for acreage and yield record keeping within USDA, and it restructures the board of directors of the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation to include more farmers. The bill provides for monitoring of agents and adjusters to combat fraud, and it strengthens the penalties for fraudulent activities. ### <! ---------- Press Release / Speech Goes Above --------- >   Home | Biography | Press Releases | Legislation | Offices | CommitteesContact Me | Services | Audio Clips | Video Clips | Mississippi

Following is Senator Cochran's statement: "Mr. President, on March 17 of this year the Senate passed S. 257, the National Missile Defense Act of 1999, by a vote of 97-3. Subsequently, the House adopted as H.R. 4 a different version of the legislation, and today the House has agreed to the substance of the Senate bill. No further action is required on the bill, and it now goes to the President for his signature. After many years of debate, Congress has passed legislation stating the national policy to be that the United States will deploy a national missile defense as soon as technologically possible. Section 2 of the bill notes that, like all discretionary programs, national missile defense is subject to the authorization and appropriation of funds. Section 3 states that we support the continued reductions in Russian nuclear force levels. There is no linkage between Russian nuclear force levels, or any arms control agreement, and the national missile defense deployment policy of the bill. I urge the President to sign this bill and put to rest the concerns of many that our country would continue its vulnerability to ballistic missile attack. With the signing of this bill, a new era of commitment to missile defense will begin." ### <! ---------- Press Release / Speech Goes Above --------- >   Home | Biography | Press Releases | Legislation | Offices | CommitteesContact Me | Services | Audio Clips | Video Clips | Mississippi

Hamilton, a junior from Pass Christian, Mississippi, was nominated by Senator Cochran to take part in Sony's educational summer program for high school juniors and seniors who demonstrate a keen interest and ability in science and mathematics. Hamilton is one of very few student to earn A's in all of his academic courses during his first semester at MSMS. He was a member of the MSMS team that recently placed first at the state Mu Alpha Theta mathematics competition. Hamilton also competed successfully in physics at Mississippi State University and the University of Southern Mississippi. In addition to his academic accomplishments, Hamilton was elected governor for next year in the MSMS Youth Legislature and is a member of the MSMS Mock Trial Team, MSMS Young Republicans, Beta Club, and the varsity soccer and cross-country teams. "Morris Hamilton will be an excellent representative of Mississippi and the United States," said Cochran. "His academic achievements, strong leadership skills, and community involvement set an example for our Nation's youth." The summer program involves a trip to Japan and includes tours of manufacturing facilities, presentations on design and engineering, visits to historical sights, and a home-stay with a host family. Nominees must be entering their junior or senior year of high school, maintain high grade point averages, and demonstrate an interest in science, math and foreign cultures. Sony seeks the leadership of Senators like Cochran, who is invited to nominate students for the program every other year. "The Sony project provides American teenagers with a unique opportunity for technological training and cultural exchanges that will enable them to meet the challenges of the future," said Cochran. ### <! ---------- Press Release / Speech Goes Above --------- >   Home | Biography | Press Releases | Legislation | Offices | CommitteesContact Me | Services | Audio Clips | Video Clips | Mississippi

It is a genuine pleasure for me to be back on the Alcorn campus. Every time I have been here I've been impressed with the warmth of the welcome I have received, but today you may have overdone it. There is always a courteous and friendly atmosphere here. I like the way everyone smiles and speaks to each other. It is refreshing and distinctive, and it helps make this a special place. It is also special because of its unique history, and it is special because of its importance to the present generation, under the very capable and impressive leadership of President Clinton Bristow. The last time I was here for a commencement, President George Bush was the speaker, and his presence attracted much favorable attention to Alcorn. Today, I am interested in talking not just about Alcorn's history but about the future, and the role this University can play in making the future better than the past. Two examples of the potential for a brighter future come to mind. . . . The Alcorn debate team that won first place in the National Tournament sponsored by the Association of African American Honors Program; and the Basketball Team that won the Southwest Athletic Conference Championship. These examples are evidence of a competitive spirit on this campus, and the willingness to work hard to achieve your goals. I believe other successes will follow for Alcorn students and for this University. There is the potential here of becoming a national center of excellence in biotechnology research to improve food production, agriculture techniques, and environmental quality. The word is reaching the Congress and the executive branch of our government in Washington that at Alcorn there is an atmosphere of innovation and new opportunities for research that need to be explored. I intend to see that the University is included and not excluded. The high standards that were set when this University was begun in 1871 are reflected in the Alcornites of the year, the people of Alcorn who are the most distinguished and are so honored each year. Alcorn's students and faculty have to be inspired by the University's distinctive history and the accomplishments of its alumni. Alcorn is a university of distinction not because it was the first in so many categories but because of its first rate people. In a 1938 book entitled, Pushing Forward: A History of Alcorn A. & M. College and Portraits of Some of Its Successful Graduates, author Milan Davis reminds us of the numerous businessmen, educators, doctors, and college presidents who have been educated here at Alcorn. Though the historic Chapel, built in 1830, suggests an even older academic foundation at this site, it has been the faculty, students, and alumni of Alcorn that have created the true Lorman legacy. Alcorn is well known because of this legacy and the contributions made by many talented people who have been associated with Alcorn. Included in this legacy are United States Senator Hiram Rhodes Revels, who resigned his seat in the Senate to become the first president of this University, and United States Congressman J. R. Lynch, who, as Speaker of the Mississippi House of Representatives, signed the bill creating this University. Included in this legacy are distinguished educators, such as Dr. Levi J. Rowan, the first Alcorn graduate selected to be president of Alcorn, who was born about four miles from here, and spent 12 years as an English instructor, served 25 years as president, and presided over the most ambitious facilities expansion and student body growth in the early history of the university. Included in this legacy are civil rights pioneers, Medgar and Charles Evers, who are well known to us all for their courageous leadership. Included in this legacy is author, Alex Haley, whose father was on the faculty here and whose brother George Haley is now United States Ambassador to the Republic of Gambia. Included in this legacy are student athletes like National Football League quarterback Steve McNair; 1968 Olympic Gold medalist in track, Mildred Netter Bell; and The first Black pro football player from Mississippi, Jack Spinks, for whom this stadium is named. The Lorman legacy is more than a source of pride. It is an inspiration to the members of this graduating class and a source of confidence in the possibilities for your future. I have every confidence that your future as graduates is much more promising than it was for the graduates in Mr. Milan Davis' book, and that the future of this University is brighter today than it has ever been in its illustrious history. I remember when my parents were about to drive away after dropping me off at my dormitory to start my first year of college. My mother said, "Now remember, Thad, you can be anything you want to be." Well, I thought I wanted to be a chemical engineer, and when I got my first semester grades and I had made an A in English and a D in chemistry, I knew my plans had to change. There is some advice in this story. Don't be afraid to change your mind about what you want to do. There is so much opportunity in our society today, you can find a pathway to fulfillment. Just don't give up. That was Winston Churchill's admonition. Remember? He said, "never, never, never, give up." You are not guaranteed to achieve great success just because you are receiving a diploma today, but you are guaranteed that you will have a chance to achieve your goals, the ones you set for yourself, to be what you want to be, because of the legacy of success others have achieved who have graduated before you. I'm particularly pleased that one of the members of this graduating class, Kaeita Rankin, is coming to Washington to serve as a summer intern in my office in the United States Senate. This is an honor for her to be selected but it is also another example that the Alcorn legacy is continuing to be enlarged to include new opportunities that are exciting and fulfilling. Such is the reality of this new day of hope and promise for this graduating class, their families and this fine University. Thank you and Good luck! Go Braves!! ### <! ---------- Press Release / Speech Goes Above --------- >   Home | Biography | Press Releases | Legislation | Offices | CommitteesContact Me | Services | Audio Clips | Video Clips | Mississippi  
792	Server: Sun-ONE-Web-Server/6.1 Date: Sun, 04 Sep 2005 00:11:52 GMT Content-type: text/html Connection: close COCHRAN INTRODUCES ?DIGITAL EDUCATION ACT' <! --- Insert the Press Release Immediately Following --- > FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Contact: Beth Day May 13, 1999 (202)224-6404 COCHRAN INTRODUCES ?DIGITAL EDUCATION ACT' WASHINGTON, D. C. -- Senator Thad Cochran (R-Ms.) introduced legislation today that addresses some critical technology issues and the role of public broadcasting in education. The Digital Education Act, a bipartisan bill to amend Title III of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, includes innovative applications of progressive technology to promote the best practices in teaching and bring up to date information to classrooms throughout the country. "This bill takes the best of educational technology programing; improves those proven to work; and places renewed confidence in education's most trusted and successful content development partners," Cochran said. The legislation expands the Ready To Learn program which blends a number of services to promote early childhood education, including quality children's educational television programming broadcast by PBS, and a variety of outreach services for parents, teachers and other care givers. A two-year University of Alabama study recently completed found that Ready To Learn families watch 40 percent less television and read more often with their children. Cochran said, "The Mississippi Educational Network targets outreach services to high poverty populations who are particularly disadvantaged. Families in these communities often have no reading material at home, and the first book given to a child by Mississippi Ready To Learn is likely to be the first book a child has ever owned." The Digital Education Act will build on the early successes of Ready To Learn. The bill would authorize funding to increase station grants, produce new outreach and training activities, and generate more services for more parents and care givers, so that more children start school ready to learn. Another element of the bill is the expansion of the MATHLINE program, a proven model of teacher professional development. MATHLINE uses a blend of technologies, including online communications and video, to provide quality resources and services to teachers of mathematics. Cochran said, "Our legislation would authorize the New Century Program for Distributed Teacher Professional Development. Under this new program, the successful MATHLINE model will extend to other core curriculum areas, such as literature, science and social studies, and nearly every teacher in the United States will have access to the program." The bill also authorizes the Digital Education Content Collaborative which supports the production of new digital educational materials. Under this program digital broadcasting will increase and improve the types of services local public broadcasting stations can offer schools. "Technology can revolutionize the way we teach our children and change the way they learn. It is essential that our teachers in schools take advantage of the latest educational techniques, and it is time to invest in instructional resources that will make these new networks relevant and ensure that students and teachers are prepared to benefit fully from the new technology," said Cochran. ### <! ---------- Press Release / Speech Goes Above --------- >   Home | Biography | Press Releases | Legislation | Offices | CommitteesContact Me | Services | Audio Clips | Video Clips | Mississippi

Almost one hundred fifty years ago, in July, 1849, this University had a four day long celebration of banquets and speeches at the conclusion of its first academic year, even though there were no graduates. Here is the way David Sansing described it in his sesquicentennial history of the University of Mississippi: "Every public room in Oxford was filled, nearly every family had guests, and throngs of people swelled the little village, which was one mile distant from the state university." Dr. Sansing quoted one speaker as saying: "The great gala day in country, village, and town -- the day when all business is suspended, and the whole people turn out to catch and enjoy the prevailing spirit of the occasion -- is the day of . . . the college commencement." Eight students were selected to speak, along with United States Senator, Henry S. Foote. The acting president of the University chose to speak on the topic, "If Human Nature Be Really Fallen." In his speech he criticized students who had shown "genius in freaks of mischief and scenes of dissipation." Aren't we glad things like that don't happen here now. This day is historically significant as well because at this 150th commencement of the University we are celebrating the successful beginning on this campus of a new era of excellence in education, research and service to the State of Mississippi and our nation under the superb leadership of Chancellor Robert Khayat. I congratulate the Chancellor for looking back into the history of Ole Miss for the inspiration and example of Chancellor Frederick Barnard who, more than a hundred years ago, said to the trustees that his goal was to place the University of Mississippi in "the front ranks of American collegiate institutions." The Civil War interrupted and, in effect, ended the ambitions of the University faculty and administration of that generation to achieve the level of greatness that had seemed to be within reach. Here we are again at a moment in history when being among the best seems not only possible but likely because of the talent, vision and commitment of our Chancellor, his faculty and staff, an outstanding student body and generous alumni. Ole Miss is becoming a truly outstanding place to learn and to teach, and through research to discover things previously unknown that will make our lives healthier, safer and richer than ever before imagined. From international studies to leadership training, and from acoustics and natural products research to biological field studies, new dimensions in higher education are being explored here. From strict adherence to tradition and the mores of the last century to an appreciation of the benefits of diversity, and from satisfaction with the way things were to a realization of the way things ought to be, new dimensions in social and political awareness are being observed here. From a home for Mississippi writers, to the Center for the Study of Southern Culture, a blues archive and a launching pad for chairmanship of the National Endowment for the Humanities, new dimensions of national leadership are being attained here. The conspicuous achievements of Ole Miss graduates and faculty in law and government, business, the arts and literature, the sciences and athletics have to inspire the members of this graduating class to have confidence in the possibilities for their future. I remember when my parents were about to drive away after dropping me off at Lester dormitory to begin my freshman year, my mother said: "Now remember, Thad, you can be anything you want to be." Well, I had begun to have my doubts when my aptitude tests showed I did much better in English and vocabulary and things like that than I did in math and science. I thought I wanted to be a chemical engineer and when that first semester I made an A in English and a D in chemistry, I knew my plans had to change. There is some advice in this story. Don't be afraid to change your mind about what you want to do. There is so much opportunity in our society and within the University curriculum, you can find a pathway to fulfillment. Just don't give up. That was Winston Churchill's admonition. Remember? He said "never, never, never, give up." While a degree from Ole Miss doesn't guarantee that you will be a great success, the quality of your educational experiences here and the reputation earned by thousands of previous graduates guarantee that you will be given a chance to achieve the goals you set for yourself, to satisfy your own ambitions, to be what you decide you realistically want to be. In preparing for this address, I looked at some speeches others had given, and I saw where a few years ago Bob Hope had told a graduating class in California, "I have only two words of advice for you," he said, "?Don't go'." Well, your parents and family are going to insist that you go do something else, for a while at least. But, don't forget to write, or call, or send an e-mail to thank whoever helped you get to this point in your very promising life. Good luck!

Scholtes teaches first grade at Sudduth Elementary School in Starkville, Mississippi. Cochran is a cosponsor of the Senate Resolution proclaiming May 2-8, 1999, as the 14th Annual Teacher Appreciation Week. Following is Senator Cochran's statement: Mr. President, I am proud to cosponsor the Senate Resolution proclaiming this week Teacher Appreciation Week. This week, in every state, students and parents are taking time to thank the school teachers, and we should too. They are the true heroes in our nation's effort to enrich the lives of all our citizens through education. I want to pay special tribute to a Mississippi teacher today. She is Mississippi Teacher of the Year, Mrs. Tina Fisher Scholtes, of Sudduth Elementary School in Starkville, Mississippi. Tina has been an elementary school teacher for sixteen years. She has spent the past 14 years teaching first grade in Starkville. First grade lays the foundation for formal education. Every parent hopes their child will begin school with an excellent teacher, and Tina Scholtes is without a doubt an excellent teacher. Being an excellent teacher requires hard work, along with respect for children and an understanding of the learning process. Tina has those attributes and more. She also cares about outcomes. She wants all her students to succeed. Beyond the Masters Degree she earned at Mississippi State University, Tina has completed professional development for teaching reading and mathematics; the special needs of teaching deaf students; National Board Certification; and training other teachers. Her resume is evidence of her capacity for gaining knowledge and sharing it with others. While continuing her first grade teaching, she has returned to Mississippi State University where as a clinical instructor she directs the activities of student teachers. Tina has brought new teaching techniques into the schools where she has taught. She serves as a mentor to new teachers and has developed school wide curriculum reforms. She also has used local television programs to provide early childhood education lessons to parents. Another indication that she is a dedicated teacher is her participation in the Parent Teacher Association where she served as President while teaching at Emerson Elementary School. Tina recognizes the importance of teachers participating in the community and is active in her church, and in other community activities. I was very pleased that Tina Scholtes took time to visit my office when she was in Washington recently for the National Teacher of the Year recognition events. I congratulate her on all her successes. The first graders in Starkville, Mississippi are lucky, indeed, to begin their lives as students with Tina Scholtes, and we are all grateful to her for being such a good example for other teachers to follow. ### <! ---------- Press Release / Speech Goes Above --------- >   Home | Biography | Press Releases | Legislation | Offices | CommitteesContact Me | Services | Audio Clips | Video Clips | Mississippi

The 20-member group will observe and closely monitor executive branch negotiations with foreign governments on a range of national security topics, including weapons of mass destruction, export controls, and missile defenses. A resolution establishing the group and providing for its authority was agreed to by the Senate on March 25. As part of its mandate, the group is empowered and encouraged to meet with legislators from foreign nations, including the State Duma of the Russian Federation and the Israeli Knesset, on topics of mutual interest and concern, Lott said. "By establishing a bipartisan working group to address national security threats and responses, the Senate is poised to enhance its oversight of these critical negotiations and issues," Senator Lott said. "I am particularly encouraged by the prospect of expanded cooperation and collaboration between the Senate and our colleagues in foreign legislative bodies. This new group will promote and protect the values of the Congress and the American people." Senator Daschle said, "The National Security Working Group replaces the Arms Control Observer Group. I hope this new group, like the old, provides Senators the opportunity to address key national security issues in a non-political, non-partisan manner." Senator Thad Cochran of Mississippi and Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia will act as Administrative Co-chairmen of the group. Senators Lott and Daschle will serve as members.

Cochran's remarks came during a Defense Appropriations hearing held today to discuss the fiscal year 2000 budget for the National Guard. "We understand the stresses that you are under now trying to match the needs that you have with the funding available under this president's budget. We're pleased to see some increases in the budget this year to reflect the growing importance of air and army national guard units," Cochran said to senior National Guard officials. Cochran assured the senior military officials at the hearing that "we're going to do everything we can to be sure that the Congress responds to ensure that you have the funds you need to do your job." Cochran acknowledged that the Guard commanders were busy complying with the call up order issued by the Department of Defense and mentioned that there were already Guard and reserve forces supporting the Kosovo mission, including the 186th Air Refueling Wing based in Meridian, Mississippi. The Senator questioned Lt. General Russell C. Davis, Chief of the National Guard Bureau, about what the Guard was doing to assist families and employers when National Guard and reserve personnel are called to duty. Davis responded that they were holding seminars and working to educate families and employers about what is happening and why it is necessary to have their employees away, while providing suggestions about how to handle an employee's absence. Cochran also discussed the planned enhancement of the multi-purpose range at Camp Shelby and questioned Major General Roger C. Schultz, Director of the Army National Guard, about the importance of the improved range to Guard readiness and urged the Committee to support the needed funding for completion of the project. General Schultz said that the ranges at Camp Shelby are considered a "treasure" in terms of resources for training soldiers. He said that the Guard Bureau is working on phase three of the project and that the environmental impact statement was completed. Cochran also discussed the timetable for deployment of the new C-17 aircraft to the Mississippi Air National Guard's 172nd Airlift Wing in Jackson, which will be the first guard unit in the country to receive the aircraft. He questioned the Director of the Air National Guard, Major General Paul A. Weaver, about the possibility that the C-17's would be delivered earlier than expected. General Weaver assured the Senator that the Guard is preparing to accept the C-17's, not only on time, but possibly ahead of schedule. ### <! ---------- Press Release / Speech Goes Above --------- >   Home | Biography | Press Releases | Legislation | Offices | CommitteesContact Me | Services | Audio Clips | Video Clips | Mississippi

S. Senator Thad Cochran (R-MS) praised the work of the employees of Ingalls Shipbuilding who were involved in building the USS PORTER (DDG 78), the newest in a series of advanced Aegis guided missile destroyers built in Pascagoula, MS, for the United States Navy. Cochran delivered the principal address at the ship's commissioning in Port Canaveral, Florida. "The crew of the PORTER has worked shoulder to shoulder with the men and women of the Ingalls Shipbuilding family, ensuring that the PORTER is ready to take her place on active duty in the U.S. Navy," Cochran said to the more than 4,000 guests assembled for the event. Senator Cochran, a senior member of the Senate Appropriations panel on Defense, said, "The PORTER is the 28th Arleigh Burke class Destroyer, and the 12th to be built by Ingalls. There is no doubt that the reputation of Ingalls as the best shipbuilder in America will be enhanced by PORTER." The Senator emphasized the importance of a strong U.S. Navy. He said, "Although changes in the world have significantly reduced the threat to our security from our enemies of the Cold War, the need for a strong Navy remains." "U.S. warships must be able to support operations close to land, while maintaining the ability to defeat the enemy on the high seas," Cochran said. "USS PORTER reflects the Joint Inter-operability, multi-mission capabilities our ships must possess in order to respond to any threat, whether near land or on open sea." The 505-foot, 8,850-ton destroyer, commanded by Commander Kenneth V. Spiro Jr., USN, is named to honor the distinguished naval service of Commodore David Porter and his son Vice Admiral David Dixon Porter. Garland Johnson, wife of U.S. Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Jay L. Johnson, is the ship's sponsor. In closing Cochran wished for Commander Spiro and the crew of the PORTER "a safe and successful cruise every time you put to sea." ### <! ---------- Press Release / Speech Goes Above --------- >   Home | Biography | Press Releases | Legislation | Offices | CommitteesContact Me | Services | Audio Clips | Video Clips | Mississippi

Cochran also praised students from Covenant Christian High School in Clinton, Mississippi, for their efforts to help emergency officials rescue other passengers. Following is Senator Cochran's statement as it will appear in the Congressional Record: Mr. President, we were all saddened by the accident involving the City of New Orleans Amtrak train in Illinois on Monday night. Several Mississippians lost their lives in the accident including June Bonnin of Nesbit, and Raney and Lacey Lipscomb of Lake Cormorant. I know my colleagues join me in extending our sympathy to their families. Mr. President, as is so often the case, tragedies such as this can bring out the best in individuals. Based on information provided to my office, it appears that three of the students from Covenant Christian High School in Clinton, Mississippi, who were on the train, became heroes. These students were part of a group of fifteen students returning from a spring break trip to Canada. According to persons on the scene, Michael Freeman, Caleb McNair, and Jeffrey Sartor, all 17 year old Clinton residents, quickly reacted to the situation. With fire quickly approaching from a nearby car, Michael and Caleb opened a window and began rescuing people trapped inside the train. Jeffrey and Mrs. Phyllis Hurley, a chaperone who was injured herself, began helping people get out of the train too. Caleb also assisted firefighters in getting elderly people to safety and getting a young girl freed from the wreckage. When firefighters and other help arrived, Michael was still on top of a car helping people from other cars over to the closest ladder and down from the train. Even after the young men were escorted to the side, they continued to help carry stretchers of wounded to safety. Mr. President, I extend my sympathy to all the victims and their families affected by the tragedy, and I commend the efforts of these young people and the many firefighters and emergency personnel who acted to save lives and assist the victims. ### <! ---------- Press Release / Speech Goes Above --------- >   Home | Biography | Press Releases | Legislation | Offices | CommitteesContact Me | Services | Audio Clips | Video Clips | Mississippi  
799	Server: Sun-ONE-Web-Server/6.1 Date: Sun, 04 Sep 2005 00:12:13 GMT Content-type: text/html Connection: close COCHRAN URGES SUPPORT OF NATIONAL MISSILE DEFENSE BILL <! --- Insert the Press Release Immediately Following --- > FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Contact: Beth Day March 15, 1999 (202)224-6404 COCHRAN URGES SUPPORT OF NATIONAL MISSILE DEFENSE BILL Washington, D.C. -- Senator Thad Cochran (R-MS) urged Senators to support his national missile defense bill (S.257) when the legislation was brought up for consideration on the floor of the U.S. Senate today. Following is Senator Cochran's floor statement: Mr. President, The National Missile Defense Act of 1999 will make it the policy of the United States to deploy an effective missile defense system to defend against a limited ballistic missile attack as soon as technologically possible. Today, American citizens are completely vulnerable to ballistic missile attack. Last year, when the Senate debated similar legislation, some suggested that our bill was premature, that there was not yet any reason to suspect that we were confronted with a ballistic missile threat. Now, however, there is no disagreement about the nature of the threat. Consider these recent developments: (1) In 1997, the Director of Central Intelligence said, and I quote: "gaps and uncertainties preclude a good projection of when 'rest of the world' countries will deploy ICBMs." (2) Last year, both Pakistan and Iran successfully tested new medium-range missiles, each based in some degree on a newly deployed North Korean missile, the No Dong. (3) Also last year, in July the bipartisan commission headed by the former Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld, reported its unanimous conclusions that foreign assistance to missile programs was a pervasive fact, and that new ICBM threats to the United States might appear with, quote, "little or no warning." (4) A few weeks after the Rumsfeld report, North Korea launched the Taepo Dong-1, successfully demonstrating a multiple staging capability, and using a solid-fuel third stage. According to the National Intelligence Officer for Strategic and Nuclear systems, instead of having the expected 2000 kilometer range, the Taepo Dong-1 can attack targets up to 6000 kilometers away, which puts Alaska and Hawaii within its range. The Taepo Dong-2 is expected to be able to reach the entire United States. (5) The Secretary of Defense announced in January that the ballistic missile threat to the United States was no longer in question. He said, quote: "We have crossed that threshold." These recent events have answered the question about the threat. The question today is whether we intend to defend ourselves against that threat. The National Missile Defense Act is the appropriate answer to that question. It will send a clear message ? to our adversaries, our allies, and our own citizens ? that the United States will not leave itself vulnerable to weapons of mass destruction delivered by long-range ballistic missile. Some may suggest instead a continuation of our old policy of mutual assured destruction. This was the policy of deterrence we used to deal with the threat from the former Soviet Union. Former Defense Secretary William Perry warned us about using this policy with a new class of rogue state that may be "undeterrable" in the sense that we understand that concept. The fact is we do not need to be at the mercy of a policy of mutual assured death or destruction. Assistant Secretary of Defense Edward Warner said in January of this year: "I believe that we are unlikely to turn back to the point where we will rely only on deterrence. I think over time we will rely on a combination of deterrence by threat of retaliation and this limited type of national missile defense?" Passage of this bill will also send an important message to those who are working to develop our missile defenses. The development program has suffered from the lack of a commitment to deploy the system. No other acquisition program has been handled by the Defense Department without an endpoint of deployment to aim for and reach. The National Missile Defense Act will put an end to this uncertainty by telling the talented people building this system that it will be put in the field just as soon as they can get it ready. The NMD contractor's program manager testified in the Armed Services Committee last month that passage of this legislation would be a major motivation for those building the system, saying, quote "it would make them feel better about the mission they are being asked to carry out than any one thing I can think of" [and that] "people are much more motivated by knowing that the government's truly behind this?," end of quote. Finally, passage of this bill will tell America's citizens that its government is meeting its first and most important Constitutional duty ? providing for the common defense. One legacy of the Cold War may be the absence of a defense against a massive and deliberate strategic attack from the former Soviet Union. But, vulnerability to attack by everyone who desires to threaten America does not have to continue, and our government would be irresponsible if we were to let it continue. Mr. President, there is no purpose in this bill other than to clearly establish, as a matter of policy, that the United States will deploy as soon as technologically possible an effective national missile defense system which is capable against limited threats. There are no ulterior motives, no hidden goals. There is only an intent to correct a defense policy that leaves us vulnerable to a serious and growing threat. On the subject of missile defense, there are other things the Senate could legislate, such as system architecture, schedule, cost, or ABM Treaty issues. These issues will have to be dealt with in due course. But, none of them has to be resolved in this bill, and we should not let this legislation become an effort to answer all of the questions related to missile defense. The question this bill addresses is not a simplistic one, as suggested by an Administration spokesman; it is more fundamental: Will we, or will we not, commit in a meaningful way to defending ourselves against limited ballistic missile attack? Will we tell the world the United States will not be subject to blackmail by ballistic missile? Will we tell our citizens they will not be hostages to the demands of those nations who seek to coerce the United States? We have heard many statements made to reassure us about the willingness of the United States to defend itself, but there is always an "if" attached: ? if the threat appears, if we can afford it, if other nations give us their permission. With all of these ifs, these qualifiers, we should hardly be surprised that the world doubts the United States is serious about defending itself from ballistic missile attack. And no one should be surprised that in the face of this doubt, the threat continues to grow. The National Missile Defense Act of 1999 will put an end to those doubts. It will tell the world that there is no question of "if" ? and as soon as it is able, the United States will deploy a system to defend itself against limited ballistic missile attack. I urge all Senators to support this bill. ### <! ---------- Press Release / Speech Goes Above --------- >   Home | Biography | Press Releases | Legislation | Offices | CommitteesContact Me | Services | Audio Clips | Video Clips | Mississippi

American Classic has commissioned Ingalls to design and build two new cruise ships over the next five years. The first ship is expected to be delivered in 2002. The cruise ships will operate in the Hawaiian Islands. Following is Senator Cochran's statement from the press conference: "Thank you very much Jerry St. Pe'. You may have noticed that it is really snowing right outside the Capitol here, but the sun is shining brightly in the U.S. Capitol today. We're happy that you are all here to help celebrate this special occasion for the States of Mississippi and Hawaii. I observed one time that the state flower of Hawaii is the Hibiscus, and in Mississippi, of course, it is the Magnolia. Today I hope you will notice what a nice arrangement that makes. We are very happy to be a part of this special project and this new era, as Senator Inouye so aptly describes it. It is his leadership and the leadership of Senator Trent Lott that have made this day possible. They have taken the lead on a number of maritime industry issues and national defense issues over the years they have served in the Congress. They continue to be an inspiration through their hard work and dedication to their duty. It's a pleasure to be here to celebrate this with you today. Thank you." ### <! ---------- Press Release / Speech Goes Above --------- >   Home | Biography | Press Releases | Legislation | Offices | CommitteesContact Me | Services | Audio Clips | Video Clips | Mississippi

The National Writing Project operates on a teachers-teaching-teachers professional development model. Teachers who have used successful methods for teaching writing with measured results attend Invitational Summer Institutes at their local universities. During the school year, these teachers provide workshops for other teachers to share their ideas and innovative teaching skills. "Literacy is the foundation of school and workplace success, of citizenship in a democracy, and of learning in all disciplines," Cochran said. "The National Writing Project has been instrumental in helping teachers develop better teaching skills so they can help our children improve their ability to read, write and think." Since 1973, the National Writing Project has served over 1.8 million teachers and administrators. Each year 150,000 participants benefit from the programs in one of 156 sites located in 46 states, including Mississippi. The National Writing Project operates at Mississippi State University, Jackson State University, The University of Mississippi, Alcorn State University, Valley State University, the University of Southern Mississippi, and Delta State University. "This program has proven to be one of the most effective in education today," Cochran said. "I am proud to be associated with it, and I compliment those who have made it so successful across the nation." ### <! ---------- Press Release / Speech Goes Above --------- >   Home | Biography | Press Releases | Legislation | Offices | CommitteesContact Me | Services | Audio Clips | Video Clips | Mississippi

A BILL To state the policy of the United States regarding the deployment of a missile defense system capable of defending the territory of the United States against limited ballistic missile attack. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. This Act may be cited as the "National Missile Defense Act of 1999". SEC. 2. NATIONAL MISSILE DEFENSE POLICY. It is the policy of the United States to deploy as soon as is technologically possible an effective National Missile Defense system capable of defending the territory of the United States against limited ballistic missile attack (whether accidental, unauthorized, or deliberate). (Congressional Record.) National Missile Defense Act of 1999 Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to announce today we are introducing, again, the National Missile Defense Act of 1999, a bill to make it the policy of the United States to deploy, as soon as technologically possible, a system to defend the United States against limited ballistic missile attack. I am happy to be joined by my friend, the distinguished Senator from Hawaii, Mr. Inouye, in introducing this bill. And I am pleased that we have just heard that the Secretary of Defense has announced that funds will be included in this year's budget to pay for deployment of the National Missile Defense System, acknowledging that the threat does exist, or soon will. So the administration is changing its policy now, faced with this push that was begun in the last Congress and is culminating now in the reintroduction of this legislation. Ballistic missiles are being developed and tested by a growing number of nations, some of which are hostile to the United States. Iran has declared itself self-sufficient in missile technology and expertise. It is building a missile system capable of striking Central Europe. Last year, North Korea surprised experts with its test of the Taepo Dong-1, a three-stage missile which, according to published reports, may be capable of reaching Alaska. Last July, the Rumsfeld Commission concluded that the United States may have ``little or no warning'' of the development of intercontinental ballistic missile capability by a rogue state. The United States has no defense against long-range ballistic missiles, and administration policy had been limited to development of a missile defense system and deployment only if a threat developed. Now the threat has become obvious to the administration. I welcome the announcement this morning by the Secretary of Defense that the administration is acknowledging the need to proceed with a program to develop a missile defense system to meet this threat and to deploy it. The time has come to remove all doubts about the resolve of the United States on this issue. The National Missile Defense Act of 1999 confirms this resolve as national policy. ### <! ---------- Press Release / Speech Goes Above --------- >   Home | Biography | Press Releases | Legislation | Offices | CommitteesContact Me | Services | Audio Clips | Video Clips | Mississippi

This bill would enable the Gulf States to share revenues from off-shore oil and gas wells to support coastal infrastructure development and conservation and wildlife programs. The bill will redirect to state and local governments 50 % of the revenues received annually from Federal oil and gas development on the Outer Continental Shelf. This revenue could then be used by Mississippi to preserve coastlines and wetlands and to develop the infrastructure necessary to meet the demands of offshore activity. The money directed to the states would also be invested in the Land and Water Conservation Fund and conservation and education programs. Senator Cochran said, ?This legislation would bring more than $85 million annually to Mississippi and enable us to better handle the pressures of off-shore oil and gas production.? ### <! ---------- Press Release / Speech Goes Above --------- >   Home | Biography | Press Releases | Legislation | Offices | CommitteesContact Me | Services | Audio Clips | Video Clips | Mississippi

Many of our nation's farmers for example, are facing the worst disaster in agriculture that they can remember. The economic crisis in Asia has resulted in lost markets. Severe weather conditions in some states have caused crops to fail. Other areas have been hit, and hit hard with crop diseases. The combined effect of these misfortunes has been catastrophic for many agriculture producers. And neither the president nor his Secretary of Agriculture has proposed any workable program to assist these beleaguered farmers and ranchers. This week Republicans in Congress took action that will go a long way toward bringing relief where it is needed. The House Ways and Means Committee reported out a bill that will reduce taxes and provide other benefits to farm families. It includes a permanent extension of income averaging. It enables operating losses to be carried back for five years. It prevents taxation of market transition payments until they're actually received. It allows 100 percent deductibility of health insurance by those who are self-employed beginning next year. And it accelerates exemptions from estate and gift taxes. The Republican leadership in Congress, also endorsed this week, a disaster assistance proposal to be included in the agriculture appropriations bill that will provide almost $4 billion in direct payments and benefits to farmers and ranchers. This initiative includes livestock feed assistance, increased market transition payments, disaster payments for crop yield and quality losses. And extra assistance for those who have incurred crop loses over several years, such as in the upper plains and the South. In July, the Republicans in Congress lead the way in the passage of legislation that allows farmers to receive next year's market transition payments this October, which will give them early access to $5.5 billion. The Speaker of the House also announced that he will call up for passage next week, a bill to authorize fast track negotiation of a trade agreement, to open new markets and break down barriers to trade. Market access is very important to agriculture and to our nation's economy in general. Ninety-five percent of the world's population lives outside the United States. Without good trade agreements, that give us free access to the world market place, we cannot prosper in agriculture or any other business that depends so much on exports. The president has failed to provide leadership in his own party on legislation that would provide fast track negotiating authority. He and his Secretary of Agriculture should do more to improve our trade relationships in this hemisphere and beyond. The export- enhancement program, for example, could be utilized more effectively to increase our exports. Congress is giving the administration the tools and the money to address the serious crisis we face in agriculture. It is time for the president to stop criticizing Congress, and start cooperating with us, to solve these problems. This is United States Senator Thad Cochran of Mississippi. Thanks for listening. ### <! ---------- Press Release / Speech Goes Above --------- >   Home | Biography | Press Releases | Legislation | Offices | CommitteesContact Me | Services | Audio Clips | Video Clips | Mississippi

The package announced today includes $2.25 billion in total funding to address losses due to natural disasters: $1.5 billion to assist producers who have been hit by crop losses in 1998. $675 million to provide assistance to producers who have suffered multiple-year crop losses, including 1998. $75 million for livestock feed assistance in a cost-share program available to livestock producers who lost their 1998 feed supplies to disasters, which include drought and floods. The relief package also contains market loss assistance of $1.65 billion in one-time payments similar to the Agriculture Marketing Transition payment program in the current Farm Bill. Specifically, these payments will help offset financial hardships caused by lost markets. "The plan should provide meaningful assistance to American farmers suffering from crop losses and low market prices, " Cochran said. Cochran, who chairs the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development and Related Agencies said, "This plan is necessary because America's farmers have suffered from a combination of low crop prices, natural disasters and financial stress in the agricultural export market." Cochran noted that a strong U.S. Dollar and the Asian financial crisis have caused U.S. agriculture exports to sharply decline. The U.S. Department of Agriculture projects that farm exports have declined over the past two years by 13%. ### <! ---------- Press Release / Speech Goes Above --------- >   Home | Biography | Press Releases | Legislation | Offices | CommitteesContact Me | Services | Audio Clips | Video Clips | Mississippi

"This recreational lake and complex is the result of the hard work and cooperative efforts of many who are here today. I know that the local governments and area citizens have been supporters of this project for many years," Cochran said here Saturday at the ground breaking ceremony held at the site of the proposed project. Senator Cochran said, "The lake project will create recreational and tourism opportunities that will result in the creation of new jobs for southwest Mississippi. It is expected that $20 million in private investment for recreational facilities will be made around the lake." Cochran, who is a senior member of the Senate Appropriations panel that provided the federal funding for the lake project said, "Projects like these promote our State's natural resources and help make them more accessible for the enjoyment of Mississippians and visitors alike." The Senator noted that the 1160 acre lake will provide for multiple recreational uses as well as develop habitat for wildlife and fisheries when it is completed. ### <! ---------- Press Release / Speech Goes Above --------- >   Home | Biography | Press Releases | Legislation | Offices | CommitteesContact Me | Services | Audio Clips | Video Clips | Mississippi

"I commend the efforts of all those involved in planning and building this unique facility. It will promote tourism and contribute in a positive way to the tourist industry in our State," Cochran said. Senator Cochran, a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, was instrumental in obtaining the funding necessary to build this new facility. "This Center will be a valuable new asset for those who visit the historic culture and points of interest in Natchez. It will provide information and resource materials to educate and entertain visitors while enabling them to plan and map their destinations in Natchez and around Mississippi," he added. Cochran also noted that the Natchez Visitor Center will house administrative offices of the National Park Service. The dual use of the building will meet the need for visitor services, while providing the Park Service with space at a much lower cost than constructing two separate federal facilities. Cochran said, "This is the first National Park Service visitor center to receive Intermodal Surface Transportation funds, and it represents the positive result of cooperation among the Department of Transportation, the National Park Service and state and local governments." ### <! ---------- Press Release / Speech Goes Above --------- >   Home | Biography | Press Releases | Legislation | Offices | CommitteesContact Me | Services | Audio Clips | Video Clips | Mississippi

Cochran praised the transportation bill, because it allocates the federal funds on a much more fair and equitable basis than the current formula. "Mississippi will receive over 90 percent, at least, of the highway tax contributions it makes to the trust fund, which is a lot better than the 83 percent that our State currently receives," Cochran said. Cochran was also pleased that the bill ensures more flexibility for states to decide how to spend the funds they receive from the federal highway trust fund. "The bill gives the states more flexibility to spend the money they get from the trust fund on road, highway and other transportation projects that they identify as their priorities rather than having to abide by federal priorities that do not coincide with state needs," Cochran said. Senator Cochran stressed that money spent on highway improvements, such as adding lanes and shoulders, will save lives. He said that 77 percent of all fatal accidents occurred on two-lane roads and only 14 percent were on roads with four lanes or more. Cochran said, "I am confident the flexibility provided in this bill will help Mississippi solve some of its special and most serious highway and transportation problems, especially the completion of our comprehensive four lane program." ### <! ---------- Press Release / Speech Goes Above --------- >   Home | Biography | Press Releases | Legislation | Offices | CommitteesContact Me | Services | Audio Clips | Video Clips | Mississippi

Cochran was the key sponsor of the WHIP program which was authorized by the 1996 Farm Bill. WHIP is a voluntary program which provides cost-share assistance for private landowners to implement conservation practices on their land. The program allows each state to develop and initiate conservation activities that would work best according to the needs of each state. "I am very excited about this program and the benefits it will provide across the country. In Mississippi, the population of the bobwhite quail has declined significantly over the years. I see this program as a tool to increase their numbers by providing landowners incentives to plant the critical habitat in which quail thrive," Cochran said. In this allocation, Mississippi will receive $1.3 million to provide technical and financial assistance to landowners. A total of $50 million will be available nationwide for the WHIP program through 2002. The program is administered by the Natural Resources Conservation Service of the US Department of Agriculture. ### <! ---------- Press Release / Speech Goes Above --------- >   Home | Biography | Press Releases | Legislation | Offices | CommitteesContact Me | Services | Audio Clips | Video Clips | Mississippi

Cochran told Farm Bureau members that "Congress would support continued federal funding for agriculture research at laboratories and research centers in the State of Mississippi." "We have enjoyed more growth in the agriculture research area in our State at universities and colleges than any state, and the research efforts at these facilities in Mississippi are making a big difference for the future of American agriculture, which is a continued source of pride," Cochran said. Senator Cochran also said that these research programs are designed to increase the efficiency of agriculture production, so the United States can maintain a competitive edge and provide safe, nutritious food products at lower costs enabling farmers to continue to compete more effectively with competitor countries around the world. The Senator told the group that U.S. farmers and exporters must take advantage of a growing economic opportunity outside of U.S. borders. "Ninety-five percent of the world's population live outside of the United States, so we have to design our programs to ensure that we take advantage of this growing market," Cochran said. "At the same time, the federal government has a responsibility to make sure that trade programs are administered fairly to ensure that other countries do not erect barriers which would deny U.S. farmers and exporters access to global markets." Cochran added, "It is important that we maintain the kinds of programs that will be effective and protect our farmers in times of need." Approximately 100 members of the Mississippi Farm Bureau and their families traveled to Washington to attend today's event. ### <! ---------- Press Release / Speech Goes Above --------- >   Home | Biography | Press Releases | Legislation | Offices | CommitteesContact Me | Services | Audio Clips | Video Clips | Mississippi

Week. The resolution encourages individuals and organizations across America to promote basic values and adopt the six core elements of good character. ?It has been my honor to cosponsor this resolution with Senator Pete Domenici every year since 1994,? said Cochran, who is an original member of the Character Counts Coalition in the United States Senate. ?In the past we learned the Golden Rule and were taught how to act by our parents and at Sunday School. Today, many don?t have a chance to grow up in that kind of environment, and we must develop alternative ways of teaching and learning good character traits.? The Character Counts Coalition is made up of 180-member organizations committed to the goal of teaching that character does count and is essential for our nation?s well-being and success. The six core elements are called ?Pillars of Character,? and they are: trustworthiness, respect, responsibility, fairness, caring, and citizenship. In Mississippi, Ocean Springs is a Character Counts Community. The Chamber of Commerce sponsors programs that stress the importance of making good character traits an important part of everyday life. The Ocean Springs Character Counts Business Club members display stickers in their windows and help the Chamber raise funds for programs and materials to urge local public school teachers to include character education in their curriculum. ?I am very proud of the people of Ocean Springs. They understand that teaching good character begins at home, but it must be reinforced at school and by the entire community,? Cochran said. ?If we all practiced what Character Counts teaches, America would be better indeed.? ### <! ---------- Press Release / Speech Goes Above --------- >   Home | Biography | Press Releases | Legislation | Offices | CommitteesContact Me | Services | Audio Clips | Video Clips | Mississippi

S. TO ACT DECISIVELY ON SPREAD OF WEAPONS SYSTEMS (WASHINGTON)---U. S. Senator Thad Cochran (R-MS) warned here Monday the United States should do more to deal with the growing dangers caused by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems. Senator Cochran said a Proliferation Primer his subcommittee has issued makes clear the United States may be the world's lone superpower but "we could be as vulnerable as Gulliver to smaller, rogue nations armed with nuclear, biological or chemical weapons and long-range missiles to deliver them." His remarks came at a Capitol news conference. He is chairman of the Subcommittee on International Security, Proliferation, and Federal Services of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee. The committee report released Monday describes the findings from a year- long series of hearings which examined the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction technology, missile delivery systems and key enabling technologies. The Primer, which is dedicated to the 28 American soldiers who lost their lives in the Iraqi ballistic missile attack on Dhahran, Saudia Arabia on February 25, l99l, identifies the major proliferators as Russia, China and North Korea and questions the actions of the Clinton Administration to deal with the problem. It also discusses the consequences of the administration's new policies that have relaxed controls over the export of dual-use technology such as supercomputers and examines the increasing availability of technical expertise and missile hardware. Senator Cochran said "our subcommittee has found the Clinton administration has not been willing to take the tough actions necessary to back up its rhetoric in executive orders and other statements. Rhetoric alone is not enough to protect American interests." He concluded by saying, "Now is the time to take decisive action to protect ourselves from the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems."

C. -- Senator Thad Cochran (R-MS) is cosponsoring legislation which will define more clearly prohibitions against hunting over baited areas. Under current law, if a person hunts over a baited area that person is presumed guilty whether or not they knew the site was baited. The Migratory Bird Treaty Reform Act, which was introduced today in the U.S. Senate by Senator John Breaux (D-LA) and U.S. Senator Thad Cochran (R-MS), would establish a new standard enabling hunters to prove their innocence. The bill repeals the strict liability rule presently enforced by federal courts. The legislation gives hunters an opportunity to present evidence that they were not aware bait was present. The court would determine guilt or innocence from the evidence. If the facts show that the hunter knew or should have known that the field was baited, penalties could be imposed. "This is a change in the law that is justified and overdue in my opinion. There are situations that make it impossible for innocent hunters to know if a field is baited or not. The reforms in this legislation will help prevent innocent hunters from being punished unfairly,? Cochran said. The bill also defines activities that constitute baiting. Under the bill the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service would consult with state and federal agencies and publish regulations regarding acceptable agricultural practices for different regions of the country. This guidance is designed to remove the uncertainty that currently exists among landowners, farmers, wildlife managers, law enforcement officials, and hunters about the illegality of certain agricultural practices. ### <! ---------- Press Release / Speech Goes Above --------- >   Home | Biography | Press Releases | Legislation | Offices | CommitteesContact Me | Services | Audio Clips | Video Clips | Mississippi

After a detailed evaluation of the National Weather Service budget and operations, the Secretary of Commerce, William Daley, has cancelled plans to close the Southern Regional Headquarters and decided to maintain all four regional offices across the country at reduced staff levels. In July, Senator Cochran joined with several other Senators from the Southern Region to request that the U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) assess the National Weather Service proposal to close its Southern Regional office, because this region "is a high risk region for hurricanes and other storm systems, and the public interest requires the most accurate and timely information we can get." The GAO study found that closure of the Regional Office was not supported by risk analysis. As a result, Secretary Daley had delayed closure of the Southern Regional Office pending the Department's review and its report announced today. "I am pleased that the Department of Commerce has decided to keep the Southern Regional Headquarters open and operational. This will help ensure the public safety of our region," Cochran said. ### <! ---------- Press Release / Speech Goes Above --------- >   Home | Biography | Press Releases | Legislation | Offices | CommitteesContact Me | Services | Audio Clips | Video Clips | Mississippi

EATON (WASHINGTON, D. C.)---A U. S. Senate subcommittee Thursday approved Senator Thad Cochran's bill to name the Taylorsville post office in honor of the late Blaine H. Eaton. The bill, S.916, now awaits action by the full Governmental Affairs Committee and the Senate. Mr. Eaton, a native of Smith County, was a legislator and head of the area rural electric cooperative. He was also honored by the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association for his distinguished service and outstanding leadership. Senator Cochran said, "With his death in 1995, our state lost one of its finest citizens. Designating the Taylorsville Post Office as the 'Blaine H. Eaton Post Office Building' will commemorate the public service of this extraordinary Mississippian who dedicated his life to the betterment of the community and state he loved so much." Mr. Eaton attended Jones County Junior College, where he was named Alumnus of the Year in 1984, the University of Mississippi and George Washington University Law School. He was a farmer and cotton broker early in his career and served as executive secretary to the late U. S. Senator James O. Eastland of Mississippi. Following service in the U. S. Navy in World War II, Mr. Eaton was elected to the state legislature and served twelve years in the House of Representatives. As chairman of the Highway and Highway Finance Committee, he was a leader in successful passage of the Farm-to-Market road program. After leaving public office in 1958, Mr. Eaton was manager of the Southern Pine Electric Power Association. He retired from Southern Pine EPA in 1982, but remained active in civic, community and church activities in Taylorsville and Smith County. ### <! ---------- Press Release / Speech Goes Above --------- >   Home | Biography | Press Releases | Legislation | Offices | CommitteesContact Me | Services | Audio Clips | Video Clips | Mississippi

Cochran is a member of the Committee. Following is Senator Cochran's opening statement from the hearing: "Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the tone you have set for us in your opening statement. It was a commitment to fairness, thoroughness, common courtesy and respect for others. I hope we will all respond in a positive way to this challenge you have given our committee. We do have to acknowledge first that this investigation is a work in progress. Our efforts to learn the truth are ongoing. There are still documents to be reviewed, witnesses to be interviewed, and depositions to be taken. So, what the public will see and hear at this beginning point of the hearings is just a sampling of what we have learned so far. We also should acknowledge that we have had some disappointments. Some witnesses have disappeared. Some documents have probably disappeared. Some witnesses have indicated that they will take the fifth amendment. President Clinton has not called on his White House staff or the Democratic National Committee to cooperate in the search for the facts. This is also disappointing. It may contribute to an atmosphere that suggests that it is okay to avoid discussing what really happened. One thing that we know happened in advance of the campaign last year was the development of a unique relationship between the White House and the Democratic National Committee. Senior Administration figures, such as Harold Ickes, and others at the White House, including the President himself, became actively and closely involved in making decisions with the Democratic National Committee about budgets, fundraising targets, personnel and methods to achieve political and campaign goals by using federal government resources. The line that usually is drawn between governing and party building was not only blurred by this Administration, it was erased. Another finding that I believe these hearings will disclose is that there developed at the Clinton White House an aggressive plan to use the office of the President to raise unprecedented amounts of money, rewarding large donors with travel aboard Air Force One, overnight stays at the White House, and special briefings on Administration policy plans. Some have suggested that these activities were not illegal. One of the purposes of these hearings is to help the Senate decide if the laws should be changed to make it crystal clear to all what is legal and what is not. There also will be evidence produced at these hearings of a deliberate pattern of fundraising by a Vice Chairman of the Democratic National Committee, John Huang, that involves contributions from persons and corporations that are prohibited by current law from making such contributions. Our first witness will be Richard Sullivan, who was the Finance Director at the Democratic National Committee. I expect he will help us understand how the fundraising operation was organized and how White House officials were involved in these activities. He will be able to confirm, for example, that Harold Ickes presided over the so-called weekly money meetings. Most of which were held at the White House. He will also help us understand how John Huang came to be Vice Chairman of the Democratic National Committee. After all the evidence is in, I hope the final result will be more sensitivity to and respect for the laws we have that govern our elections and a clearer understanding by the Senate of the need to improve and strengthen these laws to protect the electoral process from abuse in the future." ### <! ---------- Press Release / Speech Goes Above --------- >   Home | Biography | Press Releases | Legislation | Offices | CommitteesContact Me | Services | Audio Clips | Video Clips | Mississippi

"Teaching children to read is the highest priority in education today," Cochran said. "I am pleased to introduce the Successful Reading Research and Instruction Act to help deal with the problems of teaching children to read by creating and implementing new teaching methods and reading programs based on research which has never before been used." Cochran discussed the findings of a reading research study conducted by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) with the Director, Dr. Duane Alexander, during a recent hearing of the Labor, HHS, and Education Subcommittee on Appropriations. The NICHD described research findings that proper teaching methods have a success rate of 90 percent and that reading readiness and poor readers can be identified by simple assessments at the kindergarten level costing only ten dollars per student. Under directives from the 1985 Health Research Extension Act, this research program has involved 2,500 children over a twelve year period. "As a result of this research, techniques for early identification of those with reading problems and intervention strategies are now known, but these findings have not been passed on to administrators, teachers and parents," Cochran said. "It is time we put all this information and experience together to ensure that our Nation's children establish solid reading skills in order to meet life challenges in a confident and successful manner." ### <! ---------- Press Release / Speech Goes Above --------- >   Home | Biography | Press Releases | Legislation | Offices | CommitteesContact Me | Services | Audio Clips | Video Clips | Mississippi

Cochran has submitted a request for these additional funds to the Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense, of which he is a senior member. Secretary Cohen also plans to advance the time-table for engineering work necessary for the overhaul of the Navy's cruiser fleet and will direct that the work be done by Ingalls. This action is expected to produce between 400-500 engineering jobs at Ingalls. Following is Senator Cochran's reaction to Secretary Cohen's decisions: "The decision to award engineering work to Ingalls for cruiser overhaul is very good news for our state. It produces jobs and helps ensure that Ingalls will be an active contractor for the Navy in the years ahead. Additional ship construction will follow as funding is secured in the Congress." ### <! ---------- Press Release / Speech Goes Above --------- >   Home | Biography | Press Releases | Legislation | Offices | CommitteesContact Me | Services | Audio Clips | Video Clips | Mississippi

The position would rotate between the Army National Guard and the Air National Guard. "This bill would ensure that the National Guard will be appropriately represented when important decisions are made concerning defense strategy, force readiness and the allocation of resources," Cochran said. Cochran recently joined fellow Senator Trent Lott in a letter to Secretary of Defense Bill Cohen expressing their concern that the National Guard had not been properly consulted or represented in the recent Quadrennial Defense Review. "The National Guard forces have proven to be a vital component of our Nation's military, and they deserve representation when decisions are being made about their future," Cochran said. The bill is expected to be introduced when the Senate reconvenes following the Memorial Recess. ### <! ---------- Press Release / Speech Goes Above --------- >   Home | Biography | Press Releases | Legislation | Offices | CommitteesContact Me | Services | Audio Clips | Video Clips | Mississippi

"I do not support the QDR's recommendation for another round of base closures, and I would vote against any bill proposing to do so," said Cochran, who is a senior member of the subcommittee. "Every town in America that has a military facility is searching for ways of dealing with the possibility of another base closure process all over again. This process frightens communities and forces them to invest hundreds of thousands of dollars to try to support the presence of a facility that they have been told is important to the Air Force, yet might find its way on a hit list." "If we took all the money that went into protecting communities from possible effects of a base closure round, we could buy a lot more planes and upgrade more facilities," Cochran added. "This process is a huge expense, and I think we are making a big mistake by saying that because government institutions cannot make good decisions based on facts and evidence from the military we have to turn to independent commissioners, who are not accountable to the American people and whose decisions are not subject to any sort of appeal process." Cochran also questioned military officials about the delivery schedule for the Joint Primary Aircraft Training System (JPATS), the Air Force's new trainer planes which will replace the T-37's currently flown at Columbus A.F.B. " This base was rated the number one pilot training facility in the Air Force during the last round of base closure, yet Columbus is scheduled to be the last specialized undergraduate pilot training base to receive this new aircraft," Cochran said. "I'm concerned this decision may indicate that the Air Force does not value Columbus as it has in the past." Cochran was assured by General Ronald Fogleman, Air Force Chief of Staff, that the delivery schedule for the JPATS should not be taken as an indication that Columbus is not important to the Air Force. General Fogleman also said he could not imagine the closing of any pilot training facility, due to the pilot training demand. "The base closing experience has traumatized communities all over the country. If there is one signal that you are not in the first rank or a valued part of the Air Force structure, rumors start flying around that you're on the next base closing list," Cochran said. "I am reassured, and I hope folks back home are too. I know that Columbus AFB is a modern facility and that there has been a lot of money spent to upgrade simulators, equipment, and computerized training capacity, and I just wanted to be sure that something hasn't changed while I wasn't looking." Cochran also questioned the effects of shifting funds to pay for peacekeeping and other overseas operations rather than more immediate modernization needs, such as upgrading the air traffic control tower simulators used in training at Keesler A.F.B. "It is our job in this Committee to allocate scarce resources among competing interests and needs for the Air Force, and it seems to me that we are stretching the dollars pretty thin over the global reach," said Cochran. "The practical result of building facilities overseas is putting in jeopardy those investments we should be making here at home at facilities important to our local economies as well as our national defense.I wonder if we are taking money away from modernization efforts, such as the need to upgrade the air traffic control tower simulators at Keesler." ### <! ---------- Press Release / Speech Goes Above --------- >   Home | Biography | Press Releases | Legislation | Offices | CommitteesContact Me | Services | Audio Clips | Video Clips | Mississippi

C. --Senator Thad Cochran (R-MS) is cosponsoring legislation which would create opportunities for American workers to have more flexible work schedules. "I urge my colleagues to support the "Family-Friendly Workplace Act," Cochran said today on the floor of the U.S. Senate. "This bill creates options in the workplace and gives American families the flexibility to balance their work and family obligations." The "Family-Friendly Workplace Act," S.4, adds a section to the Fair Labor Standards Act providing private sector employees with a number of options, including the opportunity to take paid flexible leave. A worker could choose to work 35 hours one week and 45 hours the next, and they would still receive a full paycheck. "Federal employees have enjoyed flexible work schedules since 1978, and it is time to give all Americans the same choices in determining their work schedules," Cochran said. Under this bill, employees and employers could negotiate a two week schedule which would not alter the 40 hour work week. The bill would also allow employees to choose to take time-and-a-half off, instead of overtime. Employees could bank up to 240 hours of compensatory time with the option of receiving overtime pay for accrued hours at a later date. Cochran stressed that no employee would be required to participate in any of these programs, and coercion or intimidation by the employer with respect to participation is prohibited under this legislation. "This bill contains strict penalties to ensure that these options are 100 percent voluntary for American workers," said Cochran. "Nothing would change for employees who want to work a standard schedule," Cochran added. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 1960, only 39 percent of women with children between the ages of 6 and 17 were employed in the workforce. Today, 76 percent of mothers with school-age children work outside the home. "This increase of working families is not compatible with the one-size-fits-all workplace laws enacted in the 1930's," said Cochran. "It is time to give American workers the choices they need to meet the growing demands of job and family." ### <! ---------- Press Release / Speech Goes Above --------- >   Home | Biography | Press Releases | Legislation | Offices | CommitteesContact Me | Services | Audio Clips | Video Clips | Mississippi

C. -- Senator Thad Cochran (R-MS) is cosponsoring trade legislation that seeks to open foreign textile markets for U.S. textile and apparel goods. The "Customs Enforcement and Market Access Act," which will enable U.S. texile producers and manufacturers to expand into global markets without unfair trade barriers, was announced by Senator Cochran and a bipartisan group of Senators and Representatives at a Capitol Hill news conference Thursday afternoon. "Many countries who send the U.S. billions of dollars in textile and apparel goods keep their markets essentially closed to U.S. textile products," said Cochran. "This bill would increase the power of the U.S. Customs Service to enforce current trade laws and ensure that U.S. trading partners comply with present trade agreements, which would result in reduced trade barriers and increased access to global markets for U.S. products." The bill also would establish a division of Textile Enforcement within the U.S. Customs Service to help enforce current transshipping laws. Transshipping is the illegal exporting of goods that do not display the label of the country in which they were actually manufactured. This practice costs the U.S. textile industry millions of dollars and workers thousands of jobs. "Cotton is Mississippi's third largest agricultural commodity. This bill would allow Mississippi cotton producers and manufacturers to compete more effectively with foreign producers knowing that everyone was playing by the same rules," Cochran said. Other Senators involved included Wendell Ford (D-KY), Jeff Sessions (R-AL), Ernest "Fritz" Hollings (D-SC), and John Breaux (D-LA). U.S. Representative John Spratt, Jr. (D-SC) also participated in the news conference. ### <! ---------- Press Release / Speech Goes Above --------- >   Home | Biography | Press Releases | Legislation | Offices | CommitteesContact Me | Services | Audio Clips | Video Clips | Mississippi

C. -- Senator Thad Cochran (R-Ms.) is sponsoring legislation to exempt pre-paid college tuition plans from federal taxes. The "College Savings Act," which would apply to tuition plans such as Mississippi's MPACT program, was announced by Senator Cochran and a bipartisan group of Senators at a Capitol Hill news conference Thursday afternoon. "I am pleased to cosponsor legislation that helps families who save and plan for their children's educational futures," said Cochran. "This bill not only allows students to withdraw funds tax-free to pay for tuition, but it also permits these funds to be used to pay for room and board which can amount to over 40 percent of total college costs." Mississippi became one of more than fifteen states to enact college savings plans when the state legislature adopted the Mississippi Pre-paid Affordable College Tuition Plan (MPACT), which enables parents, grandparents or legal guardians to pre-pay college tuition at current rates. Payments are deductible from Mississippi income tax and can be paid in a lump sum or monthly installments. "In Mississippi, the cost of one year at a four-year college has increased 215 percent between 1985 and 1995. Our "College Savings Plan" would help families already participating in Mississippi's pre-paid tuition program and encourage other Mississippians to participate and ensure a college education for their children," Cochran said. ### <! ---------- Press Release / Speech Goes Above --------- >   Home | Biography | Press Releases | Legislation | Offices | CommitteesContact Me | Services | Audio Clips | Video Clips | Mississippi

"Farmers are being forced off their land by inheritance taxes and other unfair and excessive federal taxes, and they need the support of the Secretary of Agriculture to get the President to sign tax reform legislation being considered now by the Congress," Cochran said. Cochran also stressed the importance of continued federal support of agriculture research, and he specifically urged the Administration's continued support for the Warmwater Aquaculture Research Center at Stoneville, Mississippi. "Research is necessary to help farmers take advantage of new discoveries and technologies so their farms can be more productive and profitable," said Cochran. "The research center at Stoneville will serve as a national clearinghouse for information regarding catfish production, and it will be a great asset for our State," he added. The Senator also told the group about efforts in Congress to provide the Administration with the tools to fight unfair trade practices of other countries and competitors which deny U.S. farmers and exporters access to global markets. "This year, we are going to sell $60 billion worth of agriculture products from U.S. farms in overseas markets. Many of these farms are in Mississippi," Cochran said. Cochran also applauded the hard work of dedicated farmers and offered his continued efforts to support and promote Mississippi agriculture. "I think the future looks good for the farmers of our State. We have up-to-date methods and old fashioned attitudes of hard work that go together to make this a first class industry. Mississippi will continue to derive substantial economic benefits from agriculture for many years to come," Cochran said. Approximately 70 members of the Mississippi Farm Bureau and their families traveled to Washington to attend today's event. ### <! ---------- Press Release / Speech Goes Above --------- >   Home | Biography | Press Releases | Legislation | Offices | CommitteesContact Me | Services | Audio Clips | Video Clips | Mississippi

Education was identified as one of five priority initiatives by the Republican Congressional leadership and by the President during their meeting on Tuesday. Following are Senator Cochran's comments on education technology, specifically PBS MATHLINE: "Let me say at the outset that the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics has really been in the forefront and provided impressive leadership in the development of national standards. We hear a lot about standards and goals. We have a National Education Goals Panel on which I served at one time. But, in the math area we have seen a lot of progress in developing a consensus among mathematics teachers and leaders in this field across the country. Maybe it is a subject that is more susceptible to standardization, than others. For whatever reason, that Council deserves a lot of credit in providing leadership. In response to some of the suggestions made by the Council and by PBS, the Public Broadcasting System, an interactive teaching program was developed and was contemplated in the first legislation that was the Technology for Education Act, which was approved as a part of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act Reauthorization of 1994. So this program had its beginnings three years ago when that act was reauthorized, and we began a series of appropriations, following that, funding the program in 1995, 1996, and 1997. We had a hearing in the Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services and Education. We had math teachers, PBS officials, and experts in the development of this new interactive way of training teachers and sharing information across the country in new techniques of teaching mathematics. The response was overwhelming in terms of how this program was improving morale in the classroom among teachers. They no longer felt like they were alone and the problems in each teacher's classroom were unique. They found out that these problems were similar around the country in districts where you would think there were a lot more options and advanced funding for a lot of new techniques and modern teaching guides and the like. Even the small schools in Mississippi found that they were doing some things better than the so-called rich districts in the bigger and more wealthy states. The point of all of this is that this will serve as a model, in my view, to other kinds of technology improvements and interactive teacher training that will help improve the content of instruction and help make us a leader in the world in mathematics education. It can be, and it should be. This is something that has been going on. We are glad the President has indicated some support and asking for additional funds to be appropriated for this program. We are very proud of it, those of us who were privileged to be involved in it at its inception. We think this is a great example of things we can do using technology and the emerging satellite communications that is available to our country." ### <! ---------- Press Release / Speech Goes Above --------- >   Home | Biography | Press Releases | Legislation | Offices | CommitteesContact Me | Services | Audio Clips | Video Clips | Mississippi

The Internet is a gateway to information of great diversity in many countries and cultures around the world. Because of its international character, however, there is no external monitoring of the Internet. While most of the information accessed can be valuable and enlightening, the user may also find materials that are unreliable, personally offensive, or illegal under U.S. law (see also USA PATRIOT act). The Library cannot police a global network and each individual user must take responsibility for his or her own activities on the Internet and for the activities of his or her children. Parents are advised to supervise their children's Internet sessions and may wish to review the Library's publication, Parents' Guide to Supervising Children's Internet Experiences. All Internet resources accessible through the Library are provided equally to all Library customers. However, use of the Internet must be compatible with the Mission of the Library. It is the responsibility of each user to be guided by the following principles: Respect for the privacy and sensibilities of other users. Attention to the legal protection provided by copyright and license to programs and data. Consideration for the integrity of computing systems. For example, users must not intentionally develop programs to harass other users or to infiltrate a computer or computing system, or develop programs that may damage or alter the software components of this or other computing systems. Further examples of unacceptable use include, but are not limited to, the following: Damaging or destroying equipment, software, or data belonging to the Library or to other users, including adding, altering, or deleting files on Library workstation hard drives or other Library computer equipment. Unauthorized copying of copyrighted material. Violating software license agreements. Violating computer system or network integrity, including attempts to bypass network security functions, obtain passwords, or alter the configuration of Library workstations in any way. Harassing others. Using the Internet for any illegal activity. Gambling on the Internet. Wasting finite resources (including printing without paying). ?43.22 of the Texas Penal Code prohibits the intentional or knowing display of an obscene photograph, drawing, or visual representation, while being reckless about whether a person is present who will be offended or alarmed by the display. ?43.24 of the Texas Penal Code prohibits the display of harmful material, defined in the law similarly to indecent material under federal law, if the displayer is reckless about whether a minor is present who will be offended or alarmed by the display. For more information, see the complete text of  Sections 43.22 and 43.24 of the Texas Penal Code. The Library reserves the right to terminate the Internet access privileges of any person abusing these principles. The Library has prepared a World Wide Web home page to assist users in their Internet searches and staff have identified and recommended specific starting points on the Library's home page. While users are encouraged to access the Internet, the information needed may be more easily available through the Library's more traditional resources. Library staff will assist users in locating these materials. While Library staff are happy to assist users in accessing the Internet, each user is nevertheless responsible for his or her own search. Staff cannot provide in-depth personal training in the use of the Internet or of personal computers. Library staff will not perform reference searches on the Internet at the request of telephone customers. The Library will provide primary access to the Internet through the World Wide Web via the Microsoft Internet Explorer graphical browser.

The Internet is also a new opportunity for children to expand their minds and experiences, and to develop skills necessary for the future. The quality of a child's experience will be directly related to a parent's investment in that experience. If you take the time, you can make your child's Internet activities positive, productive, and educational. No individual, company, or government controls or monitors the Internet. While most of the information accessed can be valuable and enlightening, the user may also find materials that are unreliable, personally offensive, or illegal under U.S. law. Therefore, parents are advised to supervise their children's Internet sessions at the Library. By taking responsibility for their children's online computer use, whether at the Library or at home, parents can minimize any potential risks associated with online computer use. Most of the following guidelines apply to home use of the Internet. However, there are many suggestions here that will help you monitor your child's use of the Internet at the Library. Be aware of your children's online activities. If certain online material is offensive to you, take the time to teach your child your values. Explain to your child why you believe the material is wrong and the harm you believe it might cause. Should you become aware of the transmission, use, or viewing of child pornography while online, immediately notify your online service, if at home, or the librarian, if at the Library. You should also report it to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children by calling 1-800-843-5678. Never give out identifying informationhome address, school name, or telephone numberin a public message or anywhere else, and be sure you're dealing with someone whom both you and your children know and trust before giving out any information via e-mail. Think carefully before revealing any personal information such as age, marital status, or financial information. Consider using a pseudonym or unlisting your child's name if your Internet Service Provider allows it. Have your child use a nickname distinct from his or her real name when entering chat rooms, bulletin boards, and other public rooms. Never allow a child to arrange a face-to-face meeting with another computer user without parental permission. If a meeting is arranged, make the first one in a public spot, and be sure to accompany your child. Never respond to messages that are suggestive, obscene, belligerent, threatening, or make you feel uncomfortable. Encourage your children to tell you if they encounter such messages. If you or your child receives a message that is harassing, of a sexual nature, or threatening, forward a copy of the message to your service provider and ask for their assistance. Remember that people online may not be who they seem. Because you can't see or hear the person, it would be easy for someone to misrepresent him or herself. Remember that not everything you read online is true. Any offer that's "too good to be true" probably is. Be very careful about any offers that involve your coming to a meeting or allowing someone to visit your house. Report suspicious activity. Some conduct is illegal in both the real and the virtual world. If someone is harassing your child, keep copies and records of the messages and let the authorities know. You may also wish to notify the systems administrator of both your service and the service from which the message was transmitted. Make the Internet a family activity. Consider keeping the computer in a family room rather than in the child's bedroom. Get to know your children's "online friends" just as you get to know their other friends. Set reasonable rules and guidelines for computer use by your children (see "My Rules for Online Safety" as an example). Discuss these rules and post them near the computer as a reminder. Remember to monitor your children's compliance with these rules, especially when it comes to the amount of time spent on the computer. Remember that personal computers and online services should not be regarded as electronic baby-sitters. Get to know the Internet services your child uses. If you don't know how to log on, ask your child to show you. Find out what kinds of information it offers and whether there are ways for parents to block objectionable material. Inquire into the availability of child accounts. Some online services have special accounts geared for children, with restricted access to chat rooms and the Internet. Be careful when setting up accounts that the information provided will not be publicly available. Consider purchasing filtering software. There are a number of programs that filter and block access to adult Internet sites. Some are listed below; click on the link to each service's World Wide Web site for further information: Bess, the Internet Retriever CYBERsitter Cyber Patrol Net Nanny SafeSurf SurfWatch Monitor your credit card bill. Many adult Internet sites require credit cards in order to gain access. Review Internet sites dealing with child safety on the Internet, such as: CyberAngels FBI Safety Tips for Kids on the Internet Missing and Exploited Children's Program PC Magazine: Internet Filtering Utilities Background and reviews The Safe Child HomePage SafeKids Internet street smarts from Microsoft and the Naperville (Ill.) Police Dept. SafeKids.com Staying Street Smart on the Web! Resources from Yahoo Give your child a copy of "My Rules for Online Safety." My Rules for Online Safety I will not give out personal information such as my address, telephone number, my parent's work address or telephone number, or the name or location of my school without my parent's permission. I will tell my parents right away if I come across any information that makes me feel uncomfortable. I will never agree to get together with someone I "meet" online without first checking with my parents. If my parents agree to the meeting, I will be sure that it is in a public place and will bring my mother or father along. I will never send a person my picture or anything else without first checking with my parents. I will not respond to any messages that are mean or in any way make me feel uncomfortable. If I do, I will tell my parents right away so that they can contact the Internet Service Provider. I will talk with my parents so that we can set up rules for going online. We will decide on the time of day that I can be online, the length of time I can be online, and appropriate areas for me to visit. I will not access other areas or break these rules without their permission.

Introduction Recognizing the continuing need to achieve the national ozone standard and the ozone requirements of the State Implementation Plan, the Dallas Public Library supports actions by the City of Dallas to provide leadership in reducing Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) and Nitrogen Oxide (NOx) emissions during Ozone Watches and Ozone Warnings. This plan is issued in support of City initiatives to reduce VOC and NOx emissions and to provide Library staff with guidance during Ozone Watches and Ozone Warnings. Imminent threats to public health and safety will be addressed without regard to Ozone Watch or Ozone Warning notifications. top Ozone Watches and Warnings Ozone Watches and Warnings are issued by the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission when weather conditions are right (such as high temperatures and low wind) for heavy Ozone buildup the next day so that businesses and individuals can take actions to reduce the amount of VOC emissions and thus decrease the likelihood of exceeding the Ozone limit. Ozone Watch: conditions are favorable for the formation of high ozone on the next day. Ozone Warning: conditions have reached a condition of high ozone. Ozone action notifications will be sent to each Library facility by fax. Watches and Warnings should be received by 4:00 p.m. on the day preceding the alert. All employees should be reminded to check newspapers and radio and television stations for announcements of Ozone Watches and Warnings. top Mandatory Departmental Responses Library public service schedules limit the number of positions that may work at home; however, in certain circumstances, designated employees may be allowed to work at home. Written authorizations to allow employees to work at home must be approved and signed by the Unit Manager and the Administrator. Documentation must be maintained to detail how the Department's mission will be accomplished by allowing a specific employee to work at home. Library activities that require vehicle trips should be scheduled after 10:00 a.m. Library deliveries will be delayed until 10:00 a.m. on Ozone Watch/Warning days. If Watches or Warnings are in effect on days branches submit timesheets, branches may fax timesheets to Library Human Resources, if needed, and send originals in the next regular delivery. Library employees driving vehicles on official City business will restrict activities that entail idling of engines just to use air conditioning. top Departmental Options Library public service schedules limit the number of positions that may use a four ten-hour day schedule; however, positions that are not in direct public service may be identified to work four ten-hour days rather than five eight-hour days. All summer meetings that require vehicle trips will be scheduled after 10:00 a.m. top Individual Employee Responses Each employee is encouraged to develop and use a plan for public transportation or carpooling on Ozone Watch and Warning days. Employees are urged not to use vehicles during lunch. Employees should cancel all non-essential vehicle trips during the day and postpone essential trips to the afternoon. top Unit Managers and Administrators should record additional costs, including costs of lowered productivity, caused by the department's response to Ozone Watches and Warnings, and maintain this documentation.

Why do some items in the catalog say "The library currently has no holdings for this edition."? There are a few reasons that items are sometimes in the catalog with "no holdings".  The item may be on order.  Records are created when items are ordered, but holdings are not added until the items are received.  These order records are always list first in search results, so sometimes you will see several items with no holdings. It could also be that all copies of the item have been checked out and are long overdue.  This will cause the catalog to say "the library has no holdings".  Another possibility is that the holdings have been removed from an incorrect record and added to a correct one. So, though there are several reasons you may see a record with no holdings, please ask a librarian for assistance.  A librarian at one of our branches or at the Central library will be happy to assist you to let you know if the item is on order or if it could be borrowed from another library on Interlibrary Loan. top Frequently Asked Circulation Questions Dallas Public Library HomePage Web Catalog | Databases | Bestsellers Library Locations | Events | Explore the Internet | Local Info

A PIN is assigned to your library account when your account is created, and functions like a password for your account. If you don't know your PIN number, contact Central Library Circulation at 214-670-1740, or circulation staff at any branch library for assistance.  Have your Dallas Public Library card ready, as staff will need this information. Library staff can also change your current PIN number for you.   You can also change your PIN number yourself on the web catalog's About My Account page. top Frequently Asked Library Questions Dallas Public Library HomePage Web Catalog | Databases | Bestsellers Library Locations | Events | Explore the Internet | Local Info

The purpose of the fund is to provide the library with a collection of books and other materials for children and adults on the care of pets.  Children's stories about animals are also included in the collection, in the hope that the care of and love for animals can be instilled in children. A bookplate, containing the name of the pet or person to be memorialized and donor, is placed in the memorial book.  Each time a book is given to honor a pet or a person, a page will be added to the Pet Memory book showing the name of the pet or person, the name of the person making the donation, and the date.  The book will be permanently housed in the Business and Technology division of the Central Library. Animal lovers, pet owners or friends wishing to contribute to the fund may fill out the form and send their checks to the Pet Memorial Fund, Dallas Public Library, 1515 Young Street, Dallas, TX  75201.

The Murphy & Bolanz Company was an early Dallas real estate development firm established in 1874 (and exists today as Bolanz & Miller). The collection includes 3 Addition books, 6 Block books, and an index. The firm used these volumes to trace and record the growth of Dallas. The collection consists of approximately 3500 maps, or about 400 maps per volume. This site was made possible by a generous grant from the TexTreasures program administered by the Texas State Library & Archives and funded by the Institute of Museum and Library Services. Select the "About this site" link to the left to find out more about the collection. You can access images in three ways. You can search the collection by street name, addition name, personal name, building name, railroad, or a geographic feature (creek, etc.). You can also use one of the two indexes. The index that was part of the original collection has been transcribed and is available. Also, we created a block index if you know the city block number(s) you are researching. In addition, we scanned 10 loose maps and sheets as a separate Miscellaneous Pages section. These pages were found loose and did not seem to fit anywhere else in the collection.

Nearly thirty years after the opening of the largest facility in the cityâs public library system, renovations to the Dallas West Branch Library are now complete.  In the spirit of the original Howard Meyer design, the remodel ensures that the structure respects the site and conveys a warm austerity expressing Meyerâs love of natural materials.  In fact, the exterior of the building was refreshed to enhance the original design.  Better lighting, landscaping and security cameras were added in the parking lot. In addition, there are new sidewalks, an irrigation system, newly resurfaced parking lot and a monument sign to better designate the library.  The nearly $2 million renovation includes a reconfigured auditorium/classroom area with storage and a kitchen, plus 10 additional computer workstations; new carpet, wall covering, and paint; new furniture; and new lighting!

A tireless civic volunteer, Mrs. Exall helped raise $11,000, including the first donation of a half-dollar from Adamo Janelli of the Salvation Army, and other early gifts from public school teachers, A. H. Belo of the Dallas Morning News and local businessmen. The Dallas Public Library became a reality when Mrs. Exall requested and received a $50,000 grant from steel baron Andrew Carnegie to construct the first library building. On October 30, 1901, the original Carnegie library opened at the corner of Harwood and Commerce streets with just 9,852 volumes, managed by a head librarian and three assistants. The two-story building housed the entire collection on the first floor, with the Carnegie Hall auditorium and the Art Room, the first public art gallery in Dallas, on the second floor. The art collection would later become the heart of the internationally known Dallas Museum of Art. The Oak Cliff branch opened in 1914 to serve the citizens of this recently annexed area. Although the Depression seemed to dry up all hope, Dallas citizens hunger for literature continued. The 1930s saw four additional branches open, including the Paul Lawrence Dunbar Library, the first serving the African-American population. During World War II, the library was fully established as a War Information Center. In 1950, with library resources and facilities stretched to the limit, supporters formed an auxiliary organization called the Friends of the Dallas Public Library to lobby for library services. In 1954, the badly deteriorating and overcrowded Carnegie facility was torn down and a contemporary six-story facility that held 433,000 books was built in its place. While construction was underway, the Library was housed at the Citys busy train depot, Union Station. Reflecting the population surge of the Baby Boom, the Dallas Public Library added 17 branches during the sixties and seventies. In 1962, just as the civil rights and womens liberation movements were beginning, Lillian Bradshaw was named Library Director, the first woman to head a department in the City of Dallas. Days after her appointment she faced a censorship push from a Dallas councilmember, but the community and media rallied to her defense. The City Council not only overwhelmingly approved her appointment, but also passed a resolution to not censor books. By the 1970s, the Library found its Central facility overloaded and unequipped to handle the emerging technology. In 1972 the City designated an 114,000 square foot site located at the corner of Young and Ervay as the location for the new central library building. The new, technologically sophisticated structure opened in 1982 across from Dallas City Hall. It was one of the first libraries in the country to have an on-line catalog system and state-of-the-art audiovisual capabilities. The Library was renamed in 1986 as the J. Erik Jonsson Central Library, in honor of the former mayor who played a major role in its development. In 1996 the Library implemented the innovative STAR computer system, which allows patrons to access a myriad of electronic databases and the Internet. Today, the Dallas Public Library operates the J. Erik Jonsson Central Library and a network of 22 branch locations, with holdings numbering more than 2.5 million including books, magazines, videos and cassettes. The Dallas Public Library currently attracts 2.8 million visitors annually. Its 540,000 registered library cardholders checkout more than 3.8 million books and other materials every year. The state-of-the-art "Library on Wheels" Mobile Learning Center began providing service early last year to Dallas communities. This year Dallas Public Library will unveil a master plan outlining its strategy to handle the projected growth and the technological advances required to effectively serve Dallas citizens over the next decade and beyond. 100th Anniversary HomePage | History | Photographs Dallas Public Library HomePage Web Catalog | Databases | Bestsellers Library Locations | Events | Explore the Internet | Local Info

King will give Giles Lecture May 23 The Friends' 50th anniversary will be capped off with the annual luncheon on Tuesday, May 23. Due to parking limitations at the J. Erik Jonsson Central Library this event will be held at the newly renovated Adam's Mark. Larry L. King will be the guest speaker and sure to delight listeners. Born in Putnam, Texas, King is one of Texas' most prolific writers. He is known for his plays - The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas and The Night Hank Williams Died as well as his articles, essays, and short stories. His books include Warning: Writer at Work; Confessions of a White Racist; True Facts, Tall Tales & Pure Fiction; and his latest book Larry L. King: A Writer's Life in Letters or Reflections in a Bloodshot Eye. Also the author of five children, King lives in Washington, D.C., with his wife Barbara S. Blaine. March 13, 2000, marks 50 years of service to the Dallas Public Library Not until sixty years after the town had been founded did Dallas residents get their first public library building, and even then it came through a philanthropic gesture - the generosity of a gift by Andrew Carnegie. This new library, located on Commerce Street at Harwood, opened in 1902. It served a city of some 50,000 residents. Half a century later the same building was still serving a city that was ten times as big. This central building was not only overcrowded, it was badly in need of repair and the book collection was inadequate. Even though a $1 million bond program for a new building had been approved in 1945, five years later a new structure still seemed far away. The Dallas Public Library badly needed friends. Help arrived on March 13, 1950, when a group of twenty-three spirited and civic-minded citizens organized the Friends of the Dallas Public Library. They shared a sense of urgency and responsibility in expanding the library system into one that was commensurate with a rapidly growing city. The Friends launched a campaign to replace the downtown library - much-loved if by now totally inadequate - with a new building, and in 1955 a handsome new facility opened on the same site as the old one. Two decades later that new structure would also be outgrown, and in 1982 the J. Erik Jonsson Central Library opened directly across from the new City Hall Mark your calendars now for 50th anniversary festivities To kick off the 50th celebrations a razzle-dazzle birthday party will be held in the Friends' suite on Monday, March 13, from 6:00 to 8:00 p.m. This same evening a new exhibit will open entitled Spirit & Splendor: Art and Ideas in Sacred Books and Manuscripts. Displayed in the O'Hara Exhibit Hall, it will feature rare books which have been acquired by the Friends during the last 50 years. During the evening a special and unique gift that will commemorate the Friends' 50th anniversary will be presented to the Dallas Public Library. To salute the "young reader," a Wishbone Festival will be held March 18 through April 15. Wishbone, for those of you who somehow don't know about him, is a Jack Russell terrier who portrays various literary characters in books and on screen. Festival events will be held at all branches as well as Central. As noted on page one, the festivities will conclude on May 23 with the Friends annual meeting featuring Larry L. King. As a special part of the luncheon there will be a "2000 Salute in 2000. " This is a presentation of gifts of $2000 to each of the 22 branch libraries in addition to a $9000 gift to the various divisions at Central. This financial gift totalling $53000 is a way for the Friends to say thank you to the library staff for 50 years of support. Luncheon guests will be presented with a brief history of the Friends entitled The First Fifty Years, produced by Lillian Bradshaw and June Leftwich. "An Evening with Tony Hillerman" slated for October 19, 2000 The annual fall fundraiser will take a slightly different twist this year. Noted author Tony Hillerman will be the speaker, and he will be prompted by pertinent questions from Dallas Morning News columnist Steve Blow. The two should make a powerful combination. Please mark your calendars now and plan on a fun-filled evening supporting Dallas Public Libraries.   Friends' board member Mildred Oppenheimer with son Jay Oppenheimer, enjoying " An Evening with Kate and Jim Lehrer." Photo by Andy Hanson An Evening with Kate and Jim Lehrer outstanding success for Friends It is somewhat unusual to end a library fund-raiser with a "bus call" but that is exactly how "An Evening with Kate and Jim Lehrer," came to a close. At the end of the evening a library supporter from the audience requested a bus call, to which Jim Lehrer responded with the most realistic impression of a bus conductor calling out local stops. Many of you will remember that Jim Lehrer's book A Bus of My Own, is autobiographical and describes his family's close relationship with buses. Jim and Kate Lehrer sat together informally on the stage and addressed about 245 people who attended the event on October 21 at the Hyatt Regency Hotel. The couple's remarks were light-hearted, personal, and provided a snapshot of how writing is an integral and important part of their everyday lives. The crowd was lively and Mr. Lehrer continued to raise funds for the Friends by soliciting from the stage. Hard-working special events chair Sara Sue Potts had hoped to make $30,000 with this event and was delighted to surpass that goal and bring in approximately $73,000 to support the library system. Mr. and Mrs. Lehrer were very gracious to wave any speaking fees, and travel arrangements were provided by American Airlines. The before dinner V.I.P. Reception was generously underwritten by U.S. Trust. The success of this event would not be possible without generous support. Very special thanks to Underwriters, American Airlines, Raymond D. Nasher, and Cheryl and Sam Wyly; Best Friend, U.S. Trust; Patron, Sharan and Lynn Goldstein, Don Ellwood/Sandra Johnigan, Barron and Dedo Kidd, David and Debbie Kusin, The Eugene McDermott Foundation, Sara Sue and Don Potts; Close Friend, Kay and Elliot Cattarulla, Mr. and Mrs. Lawrence S. Pollock, Jr., Robert G. Pollock, Deedie and Rusty Rose, Mr. and Mrs. George A. Shutt. News Notes Long-time humanities librarian Frances Bell retired from the Dallas Public Library at the end of 1999. Many of you know Frances, who is often described as the consummate librarian. Frances' tenure has covered 38 years. In May, 1999, she was the recipient of the Lillian Moore Bradshaw Award. Friends and colleagues said farewell at a retirement party on January 12. Spring is right around the comer and with that comes the call for nominations for the A.C. Greene Award and the Lillian M. Bradshaw Award. Presented annually at the Friends' luncheon, these awards are given to the library staff person and the volunteer "who have rendered exemplary service to learning, to literature and to librarianship." Each recipient receives a check for $1,000 along with a citation of accomplishment. The Awards Committee chair for 2000 is Freda Gail Stern. Second in series highlighting Treasures of the Library. On Thursday, March 30, Mike McKissick, owner of Waterbird Traders on lower Greenville Avenue, will discuss the importance of The McDermott Collection of Navajo Blankets. This special collection is one of the largest of Navajo wearing blankets on display in the world. Please join the Friends at 7:00 p.m. in the Friends' suite on the seventh floor of the J. Erik Jonsson Central Library. Copies of the catalogue In Beauty It Is Finished will be provided. Light refreshments will be served. Reserve your place by calling the Friends' office at 214-670-1458.

The Lehrers have successfully combined their separate writing and television careers while taking on the large task of rearing three daughters. Their anecdotes should provide for a fascinating and lively evening. The Lehrers have generously waived any speaking fees so that all proceeds will benefit the library. Many of you will remember Jim Lehrer from his days in Dallas at The Dallas Morning News, the Dallas Times Herald, and KERA TV The evening will begin with a V.I.P. reception at 6:00 p.m., followed by a silent auction at 6:30 p.m. The auction will feature unique items including autographed books, homemade chocolate truffles, a wide assortment of silver jewelry, golf for four at Lakewood Country Club, a hand-tailored genealogy search, and a children's birthday party with storyteller and refreshments. Margaret McDermott and Ken and Holly Jonsson are serving as honorary chairs for the event. Sara Sue Potts is the Friends' Vice President for Special Events and guru of this function. Pat Bowman is the "auction coordinator." Music will be provided by the Stone Savage Trio. Corporate support for this year's fall event is being provided by American Airlines and U. S. Trust.

Photo by Andy Hanson Elmer Kelton delights Friends with his anecdotes about novel writing Noted Texas author Elmer Kelton gave the keynote address at the Friends' 1999 annual meeting on May 25. This lecture is sponsored each year by the Giles Lecture Fund. Approximately 175 guests attended the luncheon in the O'Hara Exhibit Hall in the J. Erik Jonsson Central Library. Long time broadcaster Alex Burton introduced Mr. Kelton. Always a highlight at the Friends' annual meeting is the presentation of the A.C. Greene and Lillian Bradshaw Awards. Both awards recognize "those who have rendered exemplary service to learning, to literature and to librarianship." The Bradshaw Award was presented to staff member Frances Bell, manager of the Humanities Division. Frances is a thirty six year veteran of DPL and an avid golfer. She is often described as the consummate librarian. The Greene Award, presented annually to a non-staff member, this year was given to two sisters, Anne Kimbrough and Marie Baldwin; long time Friends members who were responsible for creating the Giles Lecture Fund. The fund honors their parents, Dr. Robert Byron Giles and Mrs. Freda Kroger Giles. The two sisters were to share the $ 1,000 given each year to the winner, but they generously donated the money to the Giles Lecture Fund. Carol Roark, manager of the Texas/Dallas History and Archives Division of DPL, was presented with the completed oral history of Lillian Bradshaw. This special document was produced by archivist Gerald Saxon of the University of Texas at Arlington under the auspices of the Friends and funded through the generosity of the Fairfield Foundation. Copies of the history will be donated to special collections at Texas Women's University, the University of Texas at Arlington, and the University of North Texas. Friends need no reminder that Mrs. Bradshaw is the former long time director of the Dallas Public Library and former president of the Friends. Her interview provides an important and fascinating insight into library and municipal affairs. Library book budget given increase By Jane Shouse Boosted by a $250,000 budget amendment, Dallas Public Library's book budget increased for the fifth consecutive year in the 1999 00 City Budget. Now topping $3.1 million, the Library's books and materials budget has more than doubled from its 1994--95 level. Other good news is the inclusion of funding for operation of Teen Centers, the Volunteer office, the Mobile Learning Center and for a branch administrator.   With regard to library facilities, the capital budget includes $500,000 for the City's portion of a three way match in a public/private partnership for the renovation of the Central Library's 8th floor. All in all, Dallas Public Library exhibited a strong showing in a year where significant increases to city department budgets simply were not available. Many thanks to all who worked to make sure our elected officials continue to support our terrific library system. But savvy Friends know that advocacy is a year round proposition and that to be effective, we must continually voice library needs to the Mayor and City Council. It's all about the squeaky wheel. Meet Friends' volunteer Janet Balch One of the hardest working volunteer Friends of the Dallas Public Library in recent months has been board member Janet Balch. She has spent hours in the library's fine books collection organizing the periodicals, a complex job that was long overdue. Janet brings to her volunteer work a background with extensive experience as an editor for a number of distinguished publications. Most recently, she worked with publications of the S.M.U. School of Law. From 1988 to 1996 she was executive editor of the International Lawyer, a quarterly publication of the American Bar Association. Janet, a native of England, emigrated to the United States in 1959. Eight years later she became an American citizen. She is married to Franklin G. Balch 111, long time SMU political science professor. News Notes Friends' 50th Anniversary planning continues Please mark your calendars for the kick off of the 50th anniversary celebration on March 13, 2000. This will be a razzle-dazzle birthday party complete with birthday cake! The party will be held in the Friends' suite on the 7th floor of the J. Erik Jonsson Central Library. On May 23, 2000, the Annual Meeting will be at the Adam's Mark with Larry L. King giving the Giles Lecture. Other activities include a "Wishbone Festival" and a "2000" salute to the library staff.

The Development Committee, co-chaired by Ken Jonsson and Don Stone, continues to close in own their goal of $500,000 to match a challenge grant given by The Eugene McDermott Foundation to refurbish the 8th floor of the Central Library. The City of Dallas has pledged $500,000; the Philip Jonsson Foundation has committed $50,000 with an additional pledge of $100,000 for other projects; the Ida and Cecil Green Foundation contributed $50,000; an anonymous grant of $100,000 and individual contributions from Friends' members totaling $44,000 bring the goal within sight.

APRIL, 1999 / NUMBER 45   Friends 1999 annual meeting slated for May 25; Novelist Elmer Kelton to deliver Giles Lecture The Friends annual luncheon will be held on May 25 in the OHara Exhibit Hall on the 7th floor of the J. Erik Jonsson Central Library. The Friends are fortunate to have an acclaimed writer, Elmer Kelton, as the guest speaker this year. His lecture is once again funded by the generous support of the Giles Lecture Fund. That fund was created by Mrs. Arch Kimbrough and Mrs. James Baldwin in honor of their parents, Mrs. Freda Kroger Giles and Dr. Robert Byron Giles. Elmer Kelton is one of Texas and the nations most distinguished novelists. In a writing career that has spanned more than forty years, he has published thirty-six novels and garnered wide praise for his vivid portrayals of life in the west. He is a native of west Texas and the son of a rancher. In addition to writing his novels he spent fifteen years as farm and ranch writer/editor for the San Angelo Standard-Times, five years as editor of Sheep and Goat Raiser Magazine, and twenty-two years as associate editor of Livestock Weekly. In 1998 he received the first Lone Star award for lifetime achievement from the Larry McMurtry Center for Arts and Humanities at Midwestern State University. In April 1997 the Texas Legislature proclaimed Elmer Kelton Day. In 1987 he was chosen to receive the Barbara McCombs/Lon Tinkle Award for "continuing excellence in Texas letters" from the Texas Institute of Letters. In 1995 his book The Good Old Boys was made into a television movie starring Tommy Lee Jones. Six of his novels have won the Spur Award from the Western Writers of America, and four of his books have won the Western Heritage Award from the National Cowboy Hall of Fame. His newest book, The Buckskin Lines, will be available this year. Mr. Kelton holds a degree in journalism from the University of Texas at Austin. He and his wife Ann have celebrated more than 50 years of marriage. They have two sons, a daughter, and four grandchildren. Mr. Kelton will be introduced by Alex Burton, a native of Canada and adopted Texan is a popular radio and television personality and also author.   Call for Bradshaw and Greene Award nominations Always a highlight at the Friends annual meeting is the presentation of the A.C. Greene and Lillian Bradshaw Awards. The awards recognize "those who have rendered exemplary service to learning, to literature and to librarianship." The Bradshaw award is presented to a staff member, while the Greene award is granted to a non-staff member. Each recipient receives a check for $1,000 along with a citation of accomplishment. Christina A. Jonsson, chair of the Awards Committee for 1999, requests that nominations clearly state the reason the nominee would be a deserving recipient. The deadline for submission is May 3.

The Friends of the Dallas Public Library, Inc., will celebrate our 50th anniversary in the spring of 2000. On March 13, 1950, this premier service organization was founded by 23 Dallas civic leaders with a single purpose: help build an exemplary public library system for Dallas. To promote this objective over the past 50 years, Friends have provided thousands of volunteer hours, given millions of dollars and made countless positive contributions to the community awareness of this public library. The purpose of the Planning Committee, appointed by President Dena Jones, is to recognize the endeavors of the Friends, endeavors which over these fifty years have helped produce Dallas nationally recognized public library system. Four events are currently planned. Each event will salute a long-time objective of the Friends: 1) a razzle-dazzle Birthday Party in the Friends suite at the Central Library on March 13, 2000; a happy, fun time for all Friends. One of the Friends original objectives, collecting fine and rare volumes which show the history of the book, will be highlighted through display of some of the Friends finest acquisitions. 2) A Wishbone Festival will honor the Friends 50-year support of childrens library activities. PBS, Wishbones sponsor, and board member Jane Holahan, one of his mentors, will feature Wishbones dedication to the young reader. 3) A "2000" salute to the library staff. We hope to present a gift to the staff of each agency, honoring 50 years of staff partnership with the Friends to promote library development. 4) The annual luncheon in May 2000 will be our traditional spring luncheon with Giles Lecture support. This will be a very special event so we can end the first fifty years with a flourish and begin our next fifty years with hope and confidence. Perhaps some logistical changes may occur but the objectives of saluting those things which have identified the Friends for these five decades are constant. We know we can count on your help. The Planning Committee includes Shirley Pollock, Charlotte Geary, Bobbie Cullum, Sandy Melton, June Leftwich, Pat Bowman, Jane Holahan, Dena Jones, and Lillian Bradshaw as chair.   1999 slate of officers and board members will be voted on at annual meeting on May 25 The nominations committee, chaired by Sharan Goldstein, submitted a slate of candidates to the Friends Executive Committee on March 23, 1999. That slate passed and will be sent to the full board for their consideration on April 27. If the full board approves the slate it will then go for a vote before the membership at the annual meeting on May 25. Mrs. Goldstein has been assisted by committee members Lillian Bradshaw, Sandra Johnigan, Ken Jonsson, Sara Sue Potts, and Don Stone. The slate of candidates for the Executive Committee for 1999-2000 includes, Sandy Melton, Chair; Dena Jones, President; Christina A. Jonsson, Vice President for Membership; Sara Sue Potts, Vice President for Special Events; Freda Gail Stern, Vice President for Publicity; Sandra K. Johnigan, Treasurer; Chris Kosel, Assistant Treasurer; Helen Stevenson, Secretary; Kenneth B. Jonsson, Assistant Secretary; Warren Gould, Historian; and Ramiro S. Salazar, Director of Libraries.

Board members concluding their three-year term in May, 1999 are Jeannette Eppler, Cecilia McKay, Jane Shouse, and Donald J. Stone. Mr. Stone is proposed for a life-time appointment to the Elected Advisory Committee.   Friends auction item turns into delightful evening By Barbara B. Munford Dr. and Mrs. Paul Southern hosted Molly Ivins and Prudence Mackintosh and winners of the Friends Auction Celebrity Dinner, which was a top dollar item-for-bid at the Friends annual fall fund-raiser at the Hyatt Regency in October, 1998. The Southern House, as interior designer and hostess Pam Southern calls their stylish State-Thomas home near downtown Dallas, was the setting for 10 lucky guests who indulged in a wondrous six-course gourmet dinner and laughter and revelry that continued til midnight. The literary duo kept the group laughing on topics ranging from national politics to West Texas Baptists. Dr. Southern is an infectious disease expert who sat next to Prudence Mackintosh and said he never had so much fun. Molly Ivins concurred with "Viva DPL!"   The Philip R. Jonsson Foundation gives $20,000 grant for state-of-the-art computer equipment In the fall of 1998 the Friends purchased state-of-the-art computer equipment provided through a generous grant from The Philip R. Jonsson Foundation. The equipment includes two Gateway workstations complete with printers and scanner. One of the printers is a high-volume center which can handle large Friends projects with ease. Funds were also available for a facsimile work center and new telephone answering equipment. Hats off to the foundation for this generous gift and to board members Christina Jonsson and Ken Jonsson who saw the need for this technology.   Friends host Shakespeare in Love, Shakespeare in Folio Shakespearian scholar Michael Holahan of Southern Methodist University enlightened forty-six guests on Wednesday, March 10, outside the First Folio Room on the 7th floor of the Central Library. Professor Holahan explained the importance of the 1623 document which is permanently housed in a special room given to the library by Mrs. A. Earl Cullum, Jr. and members of the Dallas Shakespeare Club in April, 1998. The actual folio, a priceless document, was given to the Dallas Public Library in 1986 to commemorate the clubs 100th anniversary. The lecture was followed by refreshments and libations provided by Friends board member Karen Cassady, owner of LEpicurien. The Friends have placed a special book, Globe Restored Study of the Elizabethan Theatre by Cyril Hodges, in the Fine Arts Division of the Central Library to honor Dr. Holahans generous gift of his time and talent. This program, first in a series, was designed to highlight one of the librarys rarest treasures. The Shakespeare event was duplicated on Sunday afternoon, February 28 for Otto and Jane Wetzel who purchased the program as part of the silent auction during "A Salute to Kay Cattarulla," in October, 1998. Eighteen guests enjoyed Dr. Holahans presentation. Desserts and libations were provided through the generosity of Karen Cassady.   New computer equipment allows for email and web page capabilities New computer equipment allowed the Friends to enter the twenty-first century with an email address (friends@lib.ci.dallas.tx.us), linkage with the library network, and the librarys home page. Please visit the Friends site at http://www.lib.ci.dallas.tx.us/Friends.htm to learn about all of the Friends' activities.   Oral history of Lillian Moore Bradshaw is complete Funding provided by the Fairfield Foundation An oral history of former Dallas Public Library Director and past Friends President Lillian Moore Bradshaw has been completed by archivist and former Dallas Public Library employee Gerald Saxon. The history focuses on Mrs. Bradshaws background and her career in librarianship. The interviews were conducted on August 17 and 19, 1998. The transcription is 197 pages in length and accompanied by five audiocassette tapes and a duplication of the transcription on a computer disc. This original package will be given to the Texas/Dallas History and Archives Division at the Dallas Public Library. Three additional copies will be duplicated on acid free paper and bound. These copies will be donated to the special collections at Texas Womans University, The University of Texas at Arlington, and the University of North Texas. Support for this project was generously give by the Fairfield Foundation.   Friends hard at work raising funds for eighth floor The Development Committee, co-chaired by Don Stone and Ken Jonsson, is hard at work raising $500,000 to match the generous challenge grant from The Eugene McDermott Foundation. The City of Dallas has also pledged $500,000 for the project. This grant will focus on the refurbishment and reconfiguration of the eighth floor of the Central Library. The eighth floor is home to the genealogy and social sciences collections. The 1998 holiday letter, mailed in early December, was sent to all Friends members and garnered approximately $44,000. The Philip R. Jonsson Foundation has committed $50,000 to the project with an additional pledge of $100,000 for other projects. Grants requests are pending with several local foundations.   "An Evening with Kate and Jim Lehrer" scheduled for October 21, 1999, at the Hyatt Regency Mark your calendars for a very special evening on October 21 when the Friends will host "An Evening with Kate and Jim Lehrer." Jim Lehrer, novelist and journalist who hosts the highly acclaimed NewsHour on public television, will join his wife, Kate, also an award-winning novelist, to talk about their literary lives. Barbara B. Munford, Vice President for Special Events said, "this husband-wife team is not to be missed - their anecdotes will be fascinating." The Lehrers have strong ties to the Dallas area. Jim worked for both the Dallas Morning News and the Times Herald and later became executive director of public affairs for KERA-TV and hosted the popular nightly news program Newsroom.

By Carol Roark, Special Collections Manager, Dallas Public Library Texas history has woven into it a great deal of myth loosely based on fact. Love for that myth and its cultural trappings is firmly rooted in most native Texans and in the hearts of many transplants. So strong is the aura of Texas that visitors from other states and nations recognize (and often seek out) the "Texas bravura" regardless of whether they understand or appreciate it. Through the years, the story of Texas and its path to independence has been a major component of the mythic story of the state. Indeed, it has grown in its retelling. In some circles how Davy Crockett died is a matter of supreme importance and an issue that brings raised voices and heated words. For every champion of a particular point of view, however, there is someone-or several someones-whose study, values, and experience lead them to a different conclusion. So it is with the story of Texas's independence from Mexico. While lines may or may not have been drawn in the sand at the Alamo, the story of the events that led to the declaration of independence and the battles to secure freedom from Mexico is more complex than the emotionally charged myth filled with heroes and villains, right and wrong. This special exhibit has been made possible by and is in celebration of 50 years of support by the Friends of the Dallas Public Library, Inc.

The Texas/Dallas History and Archives Division of the Dallas Public Library collects, preserves, and makes available to researchers materials of all formats relating to the history and culture of the City of Dallas and the State of Texas. One of the largest collections of its kind, the Texas/Dallas collection is a treasure trove of local and state history. A trained staff, state-of-the-art computers, archival finding guides, and specialized indexes provide easy access to the collection. Because of the many unique and fragile resources in the Texas/Dallas collection, no items circulate outside the Library. The Dallas Public Library has been officially designated by the Texas State Library and Archives Commission as the Regional Historical Resource Depository for Dallas County. Under this agreement, older government records with permanent historical value that are no longer needed by the agency that created them may be placed on deposit in the Texas/Dallas History and Archives Division. These records are from governmental agencies other than the federal government with offices in Dallas County. Current holdings include Dallas County Civil District Court records produced before 1939, early Dallas County medical and dental registers, and early Justice of the Peace inquest records. Many of these documents have been microfilmed, and the film is available to researchers in other communities; contact your local library's Interlibrary Loan department to request the film. A list of available Dallas County documents can be found at the Texas State Library and Archives Commission's web site, Dallas County Records Available on Microfilm. ©2004 Texas/Dallas History & Archives, Dallas Public Library1515 Young St | 7th Floor | Dallas, TX 75201 | 214-670-1435 Dallas Public Library Homepage Last revised on April 28, 2005

BE INSPIRED. WRITE BACK. Letters About Literature is a national reading and writing promotion program for children and young adults sponsored in Texas by the Texas Center for the Book in cooperation with The Texas Association of School Librarians, a division of Texas Library Association and Southwest Airlines. THE CONTEST How did a book inspire you? Did it open your eyes so that you saw the world or yourself in a new way? Did it animate, motivate, or spur you into taking action to help yourself or others? Did it encourage, reassure, or just plain cheer you up when you were down? Maybe it caused your spirits to soar, your imagination to bloom, your belly to laugh, your throat to tighten, or . . . gasp! . . your heart to beat with suspense. Whatever your reaction, exploring how and why you respond to the books you read is a valuable lesson. It helps you learn more about yourself-your hopes and fears, your secret desires and your not-so-secret disappointments. To enter Letters about Literature, think about a book that inspired you, then write a personal letter to the author and explain why. DO NOT summarize the book's plot. After all, the author wrote the book and already knows what happened. What the author doesn't know is how the book affected YOU. Here's another tip: Don't write a fan letter. Forget the flattery. Instead of trying to impress, express yourself honestly. Tell the author how his or her work made a difference in your life. Then follow the how-to-enter guidelines on the next page.  COMPETITION LEVELS Level I?grades 4-6 Level II?grades 7 & 8 Level III?grades 9-12  STATE AND NATIONAL PRIZES State Level.  The top essayist on each competition level will receive a $100 cash award and a $50 Target GiftCard.

HOW TO ENTER GUIDELINES Prewriting Discussion (Adapt for grade level)  n       Select a fiction or nonfiction book, a short story, a poem or a speech (sorry, no song lyrics) you have read and about which you have strong feelings. Explore those feelings and why you reacted the way you did.  n      Make a connection between yourself and a character or an event in the story. Did the book mirror your life in some way? What questions did the author force you to ask yourself or others? What surprised you about yourself when reading this book? What strengths or flaws do you share with a characters or characters in the book?   n       Explore changes. Before-and-after is a great way to organize your thoughts. What did you believe or how did you behave before your read the book? How did your thoughts of behavior change after you read the book? Was this change in you noticeable to others? How do you know? Writing the Letter n       Recommended word count   Level I:            100 - 250 words Level II:           250 - 500 words  Level III:          500 - 750 words  n       Lead paragraph: Don?t waste words telling the author your name or where you go to school unless that somehow relates to the way the book affected you. Instead, begin with a question or an interesting but little known fact about yourself or where you live.  n       Tone:  A letter is less formal than an essay or school research paper. It is conversational, friendly. Write honestly and sincerely, using your natural voice.  But remember?this isn?t a fan letter meant to flatter the author. Correspond, don?t compliment!  Organization:  A good letter, like any good piece of writing, has a concluding paragraph that sums up the key points made in the body of the letter .

The Room offers writers a place to work closer to the library's collections and professional staff. The Room contains four lockable desks, a conference table, a telephone, and space for several hundred books. Frances Sanger Mossiker was born in Dallas in 1906. She attended The Hockaday School and went on the study French and Romance languages at Smith College, Barnard College, and the Sorbonne. Mrs. Mossiker began reviewing books for a local Dallas radio station in 1933. Her first book, The Queen's Necklace, a tale of 18th-century France, was published in 1961. Five others followed: Napoleon and Josephine, in 1964; The Affair of the Poisons, a story of Louis IV, in 1969; More Than a Queen: The Life of Josephine Bonaparte, in 1971; Pocahontas: The Life and Legend, in 1976; and Madame De Sevigne: A Life and Letters, in 1983. The New York Times said upon her death on May 9, 1975, "She wrote in a way that combined painstaking attention to detail with a lively style that made her a best-selling author on both sides of the Atlantic." In his memorial tribute to Mrs. Mossiker, Dallas Historian A. C. Greene remarked that although Frances Mossiker "was as at home in New York, Paris and London as in Dallas . . . she never for one day turned her back on her native city." Her gift of the Writers Study Room to Dallas authors attests to her continued interest in our city's cultural life. Until her last illness she was always eager to know about the occupants of the Room and interested in their writing projects. The Dallas Public Library is proud to be the custodian of Mrs. Mossiker's papers and literary memorabilia. Some of these materials are permanently on display in the Writers Study Room. We hope they will serve as a reminder of the debt of gratitude the citizens of Dallas--especially the writers--owe to Frances Sanger Mossiker. INFORMATION FOR USERS OF THE WRITERS STUDY ROOM APPLICATIONS Applications to use the Room may be obtained in the Humanities Division. A committee of staff members will review the applications and allocate spaces. The usual term of occupancy will be three months, although longer terms may be granted for projects requiring extensive research at the discretion of the committee.
